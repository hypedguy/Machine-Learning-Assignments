Baby's born on the bathroom floor
The mother prays that it'll never cry
And nothing's wrong you got your prom dress on
When they ask you say it isn't mine

Oooh, you know they're gonna know you lied

Why the hell don't you throw yourself away
You know they're gonna burn it down
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how God ain't even helping you out
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how God ain't even helping you
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away
You know they're gonna burn it down

So keep the way you feel anonymous
And hide it all until the day you die
Your secret's safe at least you thought it was
But you can only keep it for a little while

Oooh, and now you're terrified

Why the hell don't you throw yourself away
You know they're gonna burn it down
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how God ain't even helping you out
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how God ain't even helping you
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away
You know they're gonna burn it down

Baby's born on the bathroom floor
Mother prays that it'll never cry
And nothing's wrong you got your prom dress on
And when they ask you say it isn't mine

And damn you for thinkin' we would never know
And damn you for thinkin' we would never mind
Only reason that you made it this far
You never asked Him but you never try

Why the hell don't you throw yourself away
Why the hell don't you blow yourself away
You know they're gonna burn it down
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how God ain't even helping you out
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how God ain't even helping you
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how God ain't even helping you out
Wash my, hands of this
You notice how God ain't even helping you
Why the hell don't you throw yourself away
You know they're gonna burn it down---Lyrics submitted by Ikim.
