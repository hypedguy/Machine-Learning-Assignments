[Verse 1]
You don't know how little you matter
Until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas
With a little rock left in that glass dick 
Used to date a blonde
You used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved
Madly involved

[Refrain x2]
Hitting stones in glass homes
You're smoking stones, in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack Rock Crack Rock
crack rock crack rock

[Verse 2]
You're shuckin and jiving
Stealing and Robbing
To get the fixing that your itchin' for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to get a little cut up from time to time
But the freak ain't tryin' to sleep with cracky

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fucking pig get shot
Three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped
And don't no one hear the the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds
Don't no one hear the shells
Don't no one here the sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disturb Nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high 
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock 
How you feeling girl 
How's the gutter doing
crack rock---Lyrics submitted by LaShawn Drummond.
