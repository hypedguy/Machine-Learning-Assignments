I know it's hard, but you know you gotta live
Let"s Go

There's something different in your eyes baby
You can't seem to look in mine lately 
Tell me what is on your mind baby
Or I'm gonna assume that somethings wrong 

(Chorus)
I thought that you were different from the moment that we kissed
Cause all those other women couldn't care less if I lived
And I'm not really tripping
I just can't do this again
Please don't tell me your just like them
Please don't tell me your just like them 
Your'e just like them

I know that it's hard to trust of
But you need to trust that my love
Whether I need you in the dust (Yeah)

(Chorus)

Baby you ain't keeping this love on track
Will you runaway baby and then we don't have to look back
You know that i love you girl
So tell me what you're waiting for
You gotta know know know
know know know know know
know know know know 
know know know know

(Chorus)---Lyrics submitted by Tia B..
