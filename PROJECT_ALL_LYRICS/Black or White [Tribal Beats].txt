I took my baby on a saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you yes we're one and the same
Now i belive in miracles and a miracle has happened tonight
But if you thinking about my baby it don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the saturday sun I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality and it's true either you're wrong or you're right
But if you're thining about my baby it don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil Iam tired of this stuff I am tired of this business sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of you're brother I ain't scared of no sheets I ain't scared of nobody girl when the going gets mean
[RAP TIME]
Protection for gangs,clubs,and nations causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a globle scale I'd rather hear both sids of the tale
See,it's not about the races just places faces where you're blood comes from
It's where you're space is i've seen the bright get duller i'm not going to spend my life being a corlor
Don't tell me you agree with me when i saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But if you're thinking about my baby it don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking about my baby it don't matter if you're black or white
Said if you're thinking of being my brother it don't matter if you're black or white
It's black it's white it's tough for you to get by yea yea yea  It's black It's white whoo [2]---Lyrics submitted by Sheri.
