He's drunk again
It's time to fight
She must have done something wrong tonight
The living room becomes a boxing ring
It's time to run when you see him

Clenching his hands
She's just a woman
Never again

I hear her scream from down the hall
Amazing she can even talk at all
She cries to me
Go back to bed
I'm terrified that she'll wind up

Dead in his hands
She's just a woman
But never again
Been there before
But not like this
Seen it before
But not like this
Never before
Have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never again

Just tell the nurse you slipped and fell
It starts to sting as it starts to swell
She looks at you
She wants the truth
It's right out there in the waiting room

With those hands
Lookin' just as sweet as he can
Never again
Seen it before
But not like this
Been there before
But not like this
Never before
Have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman
Never again
Never again

Father's a name you haven't earned yet
You're just a child with a temper
Haven't you heard, don't hit a lady
Kickin' your ass would be a pleasure

Oh
Ohh
He's drunk again it's time to fight
Same old shit just on a different night
She grabs the gun
She's had enough
Tonight she'll find out
How fucking tough

Is this man
Pulls the trigger fast as she can
Never again
Seen it before
But not like this
Been there before
But not like this
Never before
Have I ever seen it this bad
She's just a woman

Never again
Seen it before
But not like this
Been there before
But not like this
Never before
Have I ever seen it this bad

She's just a woman
Never again
Never again
Never again
Never again---
