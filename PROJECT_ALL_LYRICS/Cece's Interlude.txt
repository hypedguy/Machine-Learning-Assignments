{verse 1}
all niqht i've, been starin'
can you tell i want you ?
can't be too, wide open
but there's nothin, i won't do
ohhh... just want  you to know

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh [oh-oh oh-oh]
See I just want what i can't have [oh-oh oh-oh]
Wont even give a chance [oh-oh oh-oh]
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious

{verse 2}
I wish i... wasn't famous
I wish i... was still in school
So that i can have you in my dorm room
I would put it on you crazy

{chorus}
That's when you start to laugh [oh-oh oh-oh]
See I just want what i can't have [oh-oh oh-oh]
Wont even give a chance [oh-oh oh-oh]
Claiming I'm not as serious as you
Shawty if you only knew
... This is serious
