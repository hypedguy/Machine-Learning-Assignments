(Intro)

I don't want to go back home I don't wanna kiss goodnight
Let us analize this moment til it dies
to the end of the earth under the valley of the stars
there's a car crashing deep inside my heart
take a ride through the rvenues across the great divide
there's a siren screaming I'm alive it cries
red alert is the color of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment passing by

(Instrumental)

take a ride through the rvenues across the great divide
there's a siren screaming I'm alive it cries
red alert is the color of your paper valentines
Interwined
Do you wanna be by valentine
so come away with me tonight with cigarettes and valentines
Cigarrettes and Valentines

(Guitar solo)

So come away with me tonight with Cigarettes and Valentines (+2)
Cigarettes and Valentines

(Insrumental Outro)---Lyrics submitted by Noah.
