VERSE 1:

HEY THERE...PRETTY GIRL. YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU GOT AND I DONT... 

BLAME YOU AT ALL,YOU CANT RESIST IT. ESPECIALLY WHEN THE LIGHTS SO 

BRIGHT, AND THE MONEY SO RIGHT, AND ITS COMING IN EVERY SINGLE NIGHT...

SHE DONT WANT TO LEAVE.

CHORUS (1X):

SHE JUST STUCK IN HOUSTONATLANTAVEGAS, (HER) HOUSTONATLANTAVEGAS,

(HER) HOUSTONATLANTAVEGAS, (HER) HOUSTONATLANTAVEGAS. SHE JUST 

STUCK IN HOUSTONATLANTAVEGAS, (HER) HOUSTONATLANTAVEGAS (HER) 

HOUSTONATLANTAVEGAS (HER) HOUSTONATLANTAVEGAS. AND SHE DANCE...TO 

THIS SONG. AND SHE DANCE...TO THIS SONG. AND IT GOES: HEY 

NOW,NOW...WATCH HER GO DOWN...OOH OOH OOHH.


VERSE 2:

SHE DOESN'T NEVER WORRY,IF SHE WANTS IT SHE GT IT ON HER OWN. AND SHE 

KNOWS THERE'S MORE TO LIFE. AND SHE'S SCARED OF ENDING UP ALONE. 

THROW YO' ONES UP IN THE AIR...THROW YO' ONE'S UP IN THE AIR FOR HER. 

THROW YO' ONE'S UP IN THE AIR...CUZ THE ONE'S YOU THROW WILL GET HER 

OUT OF...


CHROUS (1X):


VERSE 3 (RAP):

WE ALL GOT DREAMS AND WE ALL START REACHING. ALL START PEEKING, ALL-STAR 

WEEKEND. ONE HOTEL ROOM THAT ALL YALL SLEEP IN. HOUSE KEEPER KNOCK TO SEE 

IF ALL YALL DECENT. YOUNG GIRLS' ENVY THE LIFE YALL LEADING. NEVER SATISFIED 

WITH A NICE CALM EVENING. YOU BE AT THE GAMES LOOKING RIGHT ALL SEASON,BUT

YOU ALWAYS WITH ME ON THE NIGHT YALL LEAVING. ASK LO', 

ASK LO'! I ALWAYS REQUEST YOU. YOU GO GET FUCKED UP AND WE JUST SHOW UP AT

YO RESQUE. CARRY YOU INSIDE GET YOU SOME WATER AND UNDRESS YOU. I GIVE YOU

MY ALL AND THE NEXT MORNING YOU FORGET WHO...OR WHY...OR HOW... OR WHEN. 

TONIGHT IS PROBABLY ABOUT TO HAPPEN ALL OVER AGAIN. CUZ' SHE LIVE IN A MINDSET 

THAT I COULD NEVER MOVE TO. UNTIL YOU FIND YOSELF,IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE YOU.

UH,BECAUSE I NEVER HAD YOU... ALTHOUGH I WOULD BE GLAD TO. I'D PROBABLY GO 

AND TATTOO...YO NAME ON MY HEART. I SWEAR I START TO THINK...THAT I'M GOING CRAZY.


BRIDGE (1X):

THROW YO ONE'S UP IN THE AIR...THROW YO ONE'S UP IN THAIR FOR HER. THROW YO 

ONE'S UP IN THE AIR...CUZ' THE ONE'S YOU THROW WILL GET HER OUT OF...


CHORUS (1x):
