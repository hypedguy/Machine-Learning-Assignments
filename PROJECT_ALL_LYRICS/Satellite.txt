I know it's late
But something's on my mind
It couldn't wait
There's never any time
'Cause love slips by without a warning
And I'm tired of ignoring
All the space that's between you and I

Let's lock the door behind us
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go till the morning light
You can be my whole world
If I can be satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight is our only night

Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite

Do you recall
How long it must have been?
Since any room
Held only you and me
Every song it sings about it
Says that we can't live without it
Now I know just what that really means

Let's lock the door behind us
They won't find us
Make the whole world wait
While we dance around this bedroom
Like we've only got tonight
Not about to let you go till the morning light
You can be my whole world
If I can be satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
Like tonight is our only night

Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite

Dance with me around the room
You can every night
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite

I can't believe the days turned into years
I hate to see the moments disappear
But tonight the sand is stopping
Take the hourglass and drop it
So we can stay inside this atmosphere

Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite

Dance with me around the room
You can every night
Dance around this room
I'll be your satellite

Let's dance around this bedroom
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
I'll be your satellite
Let's dance around this bedroom
I'll be your satellite---
