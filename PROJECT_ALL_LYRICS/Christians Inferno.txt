I got under the grip
Between the modern hell
I got rejection letter in the mail and
It was already ripped to shreds
Seasons in a ruin and
This bitter pill is chased with blood
There's fire in my veins
And it's pouring out like a flood

Woah, Christian's inferno
Woah, Christian's inferno
Woah, Christian's inferno
Woah, Christian's inferno

This diabolic state is gracing my existence
Like a catastrophic baby
Maybe maybe you are the chemical reaction
I am the atom bomb
I am the chosen one
Toxin your reservoir
And the return man to ape

Woah, Christian's inferno
Woah, Christian's inferno
Woah, Christian's inferno
Woah, Christian's inferno---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
