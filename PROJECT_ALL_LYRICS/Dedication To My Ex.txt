Hey girl
I come to talk about this girl that had my love ya see
I went away for a while, now 
She gave my love away, and
I really shouldn't blame her
But now that pussy is a stranger

Baby, something's on my mind I gotta say it
Yeah, Your pussy done changed
It ain't the same girl and that's a shame
(A crying shame baby)
Oooh, aint being funny
I know another bee's been in that honey
Ooh, baby, that pussy done changed
It's such a shame girl and that's a shame
(Who the hell you been giving my loving to girl?)

(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)

Oooh Nooo

I guess she's feeling kinda freaky lately
It's such a shame cause now the pussys changed

Damn, darlin', do change ya oil?
I'm your number one fan belt they got nothin' harder
I don't use a cordless... microphone avoid 'em
They don't feel real to me
Meaning real woman
Others peeled on me (like paint)
You the primer on the lime bean green box when I couldn't afford a Ford
Clean socks scootin' across the floor in your grandmama house
Hand on your mouth
You yap too much about the penny ante, this mechanic so uncanny
X-men, x-men, your ex boyfirend should thank me that I took you off his
Hands
No I can bring another beach to the sand
And know I am well aware that you can bring a man to his knees
And get what you need without saying please
But can you bring a man to his feet when defeat is on repeat
And they go put this man's Grammy's on the street?
What? Why so quiet?
Hate that all of our memories happened in a Hyatt
You were perfect before you went on a diet
You was way thicker, you think I don't remember
Shit, the magazine got to your head
Now somebody you don't even know got you in bed
Bet ya buddy don't even know you don't like red
Or was it fuchsia? fuck it, our future is dead

[Lil Wayne]
I thought a pussy cat had 9 lives man

Oooh Nooo
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Oooh Nooo
She gave away all my shit
(I miss that pussy, that pussy, that pussy, that pussy)
Yeah, yeah, yeh
I miss ya girl---Lyrics submitted by maya merwe.
