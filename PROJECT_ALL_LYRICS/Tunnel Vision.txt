I know you lie
I know you lie
I know you lie...

Don't know why, but girl, I'm feeling close to you
Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these stars been dancing on my head
Too long, too long, too long!
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
Words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong!

Didn't I seem like I'm catching something?
That's because it's true,
I can't deny it, I won't try it
But I think that you know!
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you!
And I can't deny it, and I'll stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore!

A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you
Yeah, everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
Put my camera lenses on, they'd been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, becomes so clear, becomes so clear!

I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision
I only see you!
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you!

Now that I know the truth, what am I supposed to do?
Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like a movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything extra in the background, just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun

Didn't I seem like I'm catching something?
That's because it's true,
I can't deny it, I won't try it
But I think that you know!
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you!
And I can't deny it, and I'll stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore!

A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you
Yeah, everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
Put my camera lenses on, they'd been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, becomes so clear, becomes so clear!

I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision
I only see you!
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you!

Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
In on you, in, in on you!
I only see you!
Zoom, zoom, zoom
Zoom, zoom, zoom
In on you, in, in on you!
I only see you!

I know you lie
I know you lie
I know you lie...

A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you
Yeah, everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears
Yeah, a million people in a crowded room
Put my camera lenses on, they'd been set to zoom
And it all becomes so clear, becomes so clear, becomes so clear!

I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision
I only see you!
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision for you
I got, I got that tunnel vision for you
I got that tunnel vision
I only see you!

I know you lie...
I only see you!
I know you lie...
I only see you!---
