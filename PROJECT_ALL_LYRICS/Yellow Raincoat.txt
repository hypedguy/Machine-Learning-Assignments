Guess i'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby it's keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

When the wind blows, and the sun goes away
And the sand fall, sto-ormy day, it's a destroyer, this is for you
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket, destroyer, it's like this to ya

When ever do I have it, do I have it, want this to faze me
When ever do I have it, do I want this thing to make me
Cause the fame and the money and the girls will drive you crazy
And all the he say, she say, i'm thinking maybe
Just put on...

Guess i'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby it's keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

But as I look around, I see, well nothing can never, change me
Well all I gotta do, is stay me
Let the rest do the work and I'm sure that i'll be fine, be fine

When the wind blows, and the sun goes away
And the sand falls, sto-ormy day, this one is for ya, this is for ya
And as it pours down, the water sprinkles off my jacket, destroyer, it's like this for ya

When ever do I have it, do I have it, want this to faze me
When ever do I have it, do I want this thing to make me
Cause the fame, and the money, and the girls will drive you crazy
And all the he say, she said I'm thinking maybe
Just put on my...

Guess i'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby it's keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why
Just put on my...

Dudududududududududududu
(Just put on my) 
x4

Guess i'll put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
Baby it's keeping me dry
I put on my raincoat, my yellow raincoat
You know exactly why

Yeah
Ohhh
