brendas got a baby
brendas got a baby 

i hear brendas got a baby
but brendas barely got a brain
a damn shame
the girl can hardly spell her name
(thats not our problem, that up to brendas family)
well let me show you how i affects tha whole community
now brenda really never her moms and her dad was a 
junky
went in debt to his arms, its sad
cause i bet brenda doesnt even know
just cause your in tha ghetto doesnt mean you cant grow
but oh, thats a thought, my own revelation
do whatever ittakes ta resist the temptation
brenda got herself a boyfriend
her boyfriend was a cousin, now lets watch the joy end
she tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
who really didnt care to see, or give a damn if she
went out and had a church of kids
as long as when tha check came in the got first dibs
now brendas belly is gettin bigger
but no one seems to notice any change in her figure
shes 12 years old and shes having a baby
in love with tha molester, whos sexin' her crazy
and yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
and a dream of a world with the two of them together
whatever
he left her and she had the baby solo, she had it on tha
bathroom floor
and didnt know so,she didnt know what to throw away and
what ta keep
she wrapped the baby up and threw him in the trash heep
i guess she thought shed get away
wouldnt hear tha cries
she didnt realize
how much the little baby had her eyes
now the babys in tha trash heep ballin'
momma cant help him,but it hurts ta hear him calling
brenda wants to run away
momma say, you makin' me loose pay, social workers here
everyday
now brendas gotta make her own way
cant go to her famliy, they wont let her stay
no money no babysitter, she couldnt keep a job
she tried ta sell crack, but ended up getting robbed
so now whats next, there aint nothing left to sell
so she sees sex as as a way of leavin hell
its paying the rent, so she really cant complain
prostitute found slain, and brendas her name, shes got a baby
