1st verse
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said dont mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
2nd verse
She told me her name was billie jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

Bridge
People always told me be careful of what you do
And dont go around breaking young girls hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth

Chorus
Billie jean is not my lover
Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

3rd verse
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when shes in demand
Her schemes and plans
cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(do think twice)

4th verse
She told my baby,we where dancing still 3:00
Then she looked at me, she show me a photo
My baby cried, cause his eyes where like mine

Bridge
People always told me be careful of what you do
And dont go around breaking young girls hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Chorus
Billie jean is not my lover
Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie jean is not my lover
Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie jean is not my lover
Shes just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, she says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover
Billie jean is not my lover---Lyrics submitted by Bobby.
