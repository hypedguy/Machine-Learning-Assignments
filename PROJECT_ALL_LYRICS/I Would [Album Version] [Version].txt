If I could take away the pain, 
And put a smile on your face,
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, 
So you could see a better day, 
Baby I would, baby I would
(I would) 

Make a doorway to the sky, 
And hand you the keys, 
Let you know that you're always welcome, 
So that you never leave 
O-oh
Buy you all those fancy things that you only see on TV,
Yeah,
Run away to a hide away, 
We'd be living the American dream 

And I-I-I 
Know it's never gonna be that easy, 
But I know,
That he wanted us to try 

If I could take away the pain, 
And put a smile on your face,
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, 
So you could see a better day, 
Baby I would, baby I would

(Lemme hear you say)
Woah-ooh-oh-woah, 
Woah-ooh-oh-woah, 
Woah-ooh-oh-woah,
Baby I would
(I would) 

Build a love a river wide, 
So that it never runs out, 
(yeah)
Anytime they ask me why I'm smiling, 
Say that I'm satisfied 
You got your flaws, 
And so do I, 
Past lovers that makes you cry,
You know I wanna make it right,
I just can't read your mind, no

I, I, know it's never gonna be that easy, 
But I know, 
That he wanted us to try 

If I could take away the pain, 
And put a smile on your face,
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, 
So you could see a better day, 
Baby I would,
(I would) 
Baby I would

(Lemme hear you say)
Woah-ooh-oh-woah, 
Woah-ooh-oh-woah, 
Woah-ooh-oh-woah,
Baby I would

Yeah, it's not about what I want, 
It's all about what you need, 
I know that he hurt you, 
But that wasn't me
And I know and I know that sometimes it's hard to see,
That I'm where you need to be, oh

If I could take away the pain, 
And put a smile on your face,
Baby I would, baby I would
If I could make a better way, 
So you could see a better day, 
Baby I would,
(I would) 
Baby I would

(Lemme hear you say)
Woah-ooh-oh-woah, 
Woah-ooh-oh-woah, 
Woah-ooh-oh-woah,
Baby I would
