(Yea) Weed n syrup... till I die (ok)

As a matter of fact it's gon kill me, BITCH!

So Get High(Tell 'em Weezy)... Or Get Low

Chorus:
If I don't do nuthin imma ball
I'm countin all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get cha money little duffle bag boy
Say go and get cha money little duffle bag boy

And I damn sure aint bout to pick today
To start runnin look honey
I aint never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure aint bout to pick today
To start runnin look honey (Get Money)

1st Verse:
The beats so high
The flow is so ice cold
Walkin to the gucci store honey I'm home
I am on my shit I need a pamper on
Toilet paper on the side for example homey
I GET MONEY
I kno u niggaz aint heard no shit like this
And why u wishin on that fallin star
I'm in a foreign car
Smokin out wit the doors ajar
Suede sunroof hangin out the big top
You leave the dealership head to the rim shop
You niggaz barely dressin I got thousands pilin
That's that salad dressin
I'm on my thousandth island wildin... stylin I BE
I get so much money it's my I'd don't try me
And if I don't do nuthin imma fuckin ball
And I aint bout to start runnin naw nigga naw

Chorus:
If I don't do nuthin imma ball
I'm countin all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get cha money little duffle bag boy
Say go and get cha money little duffle bag boy
(Get Money)And I aint never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure aint bout to pick today
To start runnin look honey
I say I aint never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure aint bout to pick today
To start runnin (Get Money)

2nd Verse:
Aint nuthin to a boss
We ballin when u see us
We hear them haterz callin
They too far off to see us
Unless they got they glasses on
Get cha bifocal game class is now in session
Now try to stay focus man
Ya boy aint good enough style aint hood enough
Woulda coulda shoulda wont do wit us
True enough lead a hoe break a hoe
Neva nuthin new to us
Turnin hoez to housewives neva been cool wit us
Soon enough all these dealers is gonna catch up
Till then fuck it I'm winnin so imma stack up
Flows like the river the current is so rapid
Hit wit the ratchet that's how shit happens
Next time you yappin
Make sure it be about big money talk
Let that lil money walk
Call me what u want but don't call me for fun
Southside I got what u want come holla at me

Chorus:
If I don't do nuthin imma ball
I'm countin all day like the clock on the wall
Say go and get cha money little duffle bag boy
Now go and get cha money little duffle bag boy
And baby I aint never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure aint bout to pick today
To start runnin look honey
I say I aint never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure aint bout to pick today
To start runnin (Get Money)

And... If I don't do nuthin imma ball
I'm countin all day like the clock on the wall
Say go and get cha money little duffle bag boy
Now go and get cha money little duffle bag boy
(Get Money)And I aint never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure aint bout to pick today
To start runnin (Get Money)
I say I aint never ran from a nigga
And I damn sure aint bout to pick today
To start runnin (Get Money)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
