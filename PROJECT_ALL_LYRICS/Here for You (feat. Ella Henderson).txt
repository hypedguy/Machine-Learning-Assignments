We'll be passing by and I'll be wasting time
Just waiting for news
And while we're chasing darts, we'll be dancing in the dust
Cause we're coming through
Whenever you need me, I'm behind
And I've promised to take you out to the heights

When you feel you've had enough and you've wasted all your love
I'll be here for you, here for you
When the darkest of his bone and you've run away from home
I'll be here for you, here for you

I'm here for you, I'm here for you, you, you
I'm here for you, yeah, I'm here for you, you, you

And while they're underground, we'll be looking down
Cause we found the truth
And the fire in the hearts we'll be glowing up to the stars
Now we're coming through, yeah
Whenever you feeling down inside
I've promised to take you out to the heights

Ah yeah, I'm here for you
And when you feel you've had enough and you've wasted all your love
I'll be here for you

I'm here for you, I'm here for you, you, you
I'm here for you, yeah, I'm here for you, you, you---
