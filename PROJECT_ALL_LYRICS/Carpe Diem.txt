Breaking in a sweat
Like a bomb threat
Is your silhouette 
fading out

Nothing left to lose
Detonate the fuse
Another breaking news 
blowout

Ain't it beautiful
So unusual
Life's a gas and 
it's runnin' out

Living a cliche
Gonna seize the day
Bottle rockets 
and celebrate

Carpe Diem 
A battle cry
Aren't we all too
Young to die?

Ask a reason 
and no reply
Aren't we all too
young to die?

Making a living
making a killing
Whats worth forgiving
Alright

A blink of an eye
Barely scraping by
dominated by
passersby

feeling out of luck
when the traffics stuck
and you're feelin'
so left behind

Getting off a binge
get a second wind
another promise to
make a change

got a broken wing
hear the angels sing
when the signal is
out of range

Ain't it strange? (2x)

Carpe Diem 
A battle cry
Aren't we all too
Young to die?

Ask a reason 
and no reply
Aren't we all too
young to die?

Making a living
making a killing
Whats worth forgiving
Alright (2x)

Carpe Diem 
A battle cry
Aren't we all too
Young to die?---Lyrics submitted by Matty Molaro.
