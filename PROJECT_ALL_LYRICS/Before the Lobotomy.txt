Dreaming
I am only dreaming
Of another place and time
Where my family's from

Singing
I can hear them singing
When the rain have washed away
All the scattered dreams

Dying
Everyone's reminded
Hearts are washed in misery
Drenched in gasoline

Laughter
There is no more laugher
Songs of yesterday
Now live in the underground

Life before the lobotomy
Christian sang the eulogy
Sing my love a lost memory
Run the end of the century

Well, it's enough to make you sick
To cast a stone and throw a brick
When the sky is falling down
It burned your dreams into the ground

Christian's lesson is what he's been sold
We are normal and self-controlled
Remember to learn to forget
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes

Well I'm not stoned
I'm just fuck up
I got so high I can't stand up
I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessed
I'm not in love 'cause I'm a mess

Like refugees
We are lost like refugees
Like refugees
We are lost like refugees
The brutality of reality
Is the freedom that keeps me from

Dreaming
I am only dreaming
Of another place and time
Where my family's from

Singing
I can hear them singing
When the rain have washed away
All the scattered dreams

Dying
Everyone's reminded
Hearts are washed in misery
Drenched in gasoline

Laughter
There is no more laugher
Songs of yesterday
Now live in the underground---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
