Is it the time of year, I can give it,
Give it, give it, give it all
One through the note your list you can get it,
Get it, get it, get it now
Make your wish tonight
When you open your eyes
When the lights go bright girl
I'll be right there

Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, ohhh
Wanna put my ear to your chest girl
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like (Fa la la)
Know that it's christmas time

You got on my favorite dress
You're looking, looking, looking, really good
Snow falling on your hair, and I don't, I don't
Wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't out shine your eyes
Wanna be your biggest gift

Baby you deserve everything you want
It's your night, ohhh

Wanna put my ear to your chest now
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like (Fa la la)
Know that it's christmas time

I deck your heart with bells of holy
Fa la la la la
Baby cuz you're the reason to be jolly (fa la la, la la la)

I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like
Fa la la, fa la la
Baby I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby it sings to me like (Fa la la)
Know that it's christmas time Yeah yeah
Fa la la, fa la la

It's Christmas
Know that it's Christmas time
It's Christmas
Know that it's Christmas time
Fa la la, fa la la
Know that it's Christmas time
Yeah Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Charlotte Negron.
