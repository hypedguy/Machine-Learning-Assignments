Walked off the stage,
In the middle of the show
I had to go , I had to see her, see her
I must be nuts, that's what they asked me
I may be but oh I need her, need her

I need her yeah, she got my air,
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Men I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone uh

And try to be ready when I get there,
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air,
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin it in

Ohhh ohh ohh... Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh
Got the keys so we're gone uh (x2)

I'm burning out, I'm showing off..
my heartbeat loud as my sixers,s ixers.
Guys pull me over and then they ask me
If I know I'm breaking the law

I said yeah she got my air,
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Men I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone uh

And try to be ready when I get there,
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air,
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin it in

Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh
Got the keys so we're gone uh (x2)

On my way, I'm coming,
Stick shift won't get in the groove but Im coming
Traffic killing me ,barely can groove but I coming.. yeah Im coming
Phone dead can't talk to you right now
but I'm coming to get you,coming
I'm coming to get you,coming
I'm rushing cause I'm missing my boo, my my baby
You got what I what I, I, needed... Oh my baby

And try to be ready when I get there,
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I'm ready to breathe in that good air,
I'm dropping the top, I'm lettin it in

Ohhh ohh ohh... ohh ohh..
Got the keys so we're gone uh (x2)---Lyrics submitted by Jordan Williams.
