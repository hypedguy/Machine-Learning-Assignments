Just a fraction of your love 
fills the air, 
And I fall in love with you, 
All over again, 
Oooo, 
You're the light that faced the sun, 
In my world, 
I'd face a thousand years of pain
For my girl.

Out of all the things in life, 
That I could fear, 
The only thing that would hurt, 
Is if you weren't here, 

I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?

Girl with out you I'm lost
Can't face this focus at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ohh, oh
You're the common denominator, oh, yeah, woah

Before your love was low
Playin' girls was my high, aye
We chase the game that would put
My cot in the side

Broken heart rise up to say
Love is a lie,
You and I would stand
To be multiplied, yeah

Out of all the things in life, 
That I could fear, 
yeah
The only thing that would hurt me, 
Is if you weren't here, 
Woah

I don't want to go back
To just being one half of the equation
You understand what I'm sayin'?

Girl with out you I'm lost
Can't face this focus at heart
Between me and love
You're the common denominator, oh, oh, ohh, oh
You're the common denominator, oh, yeah, woah

I can't imagine life 
without your touch, 
Every kiss that you give, 
It gives me heart, 
And to all the heart it can, 
Jealous females hate it, 
I'ma hold it down for you, 

For you, woah, oh woah, 
Common denominator, 
Oh, yeah, woahh, 
I don't wanna to go back, 
Half of the equation, woah woah yeah, 
Common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh, 
Common denominator
Oh, yeah, woah

Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I'd fall in love with you all over again yeah---Lyrics submitted by Tiana.
