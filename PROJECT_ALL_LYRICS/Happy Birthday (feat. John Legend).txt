Beautiful, beautiful, no other name
I knew from the moment you came
I've seen in your eyes the dawn of a day
Where nothing will ever be the same

Feel my heart beating through my chest
I'll get used to just saying "yes"
Yes, I'll love you with all I am
Yes, tonight is where we begin

Ooh, I wanna dance with you
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you
I'll do anything for you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Tonight, my love all I want
I wanna sing for you
Yeah, I'll sing for you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you

Love you, in love for the rest of my days
Pray you'll find joy through your pain
I can't protect you from every heartbreak
The world isn't easy that way

But I'll be there for you when you crawl
Then I'll pick you up when you fall
Yes, I'll love you with all I am
Yes, tonight is where we begin

Ooh, I wanna dance with you
Ooh, I'll promise to stand for you
I'll do anything for you
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Tonight, my love all I want
I wanna sing for you
Yeah, I'll sing for you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday, baby
Happy birthday to you

Beautiful, beautiful, no other name
I knew from the moment you came---
