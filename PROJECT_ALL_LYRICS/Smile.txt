Oh, yeah

I wait on you forever
Any day, hand and foot
Your world is my world, yeah
Ain't no way you ever gon'
Get any less then you should

Cause baby
You smile, I smile, oh
Cause whenever
You smile, I smile
Hey, hey, hey
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I know it's gonna do what they say
If you need me,
I'll come running from a thousand miles away

When you smile, I smile
Woah oh oh oh
You smile, I smile, hey

Baby take my open heart
And all it offers
Cause this is as unconditional
As it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothin yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more

Cause baby
You smile, I smile
Woah oh oh oh
You smile, I smile
Hey hey hey
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
Make me smile baby

Baby you won't ever want for nothing
You are my answer and my means now
With you there's no in between
I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table
And I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish
Cause it's my command

Hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile
Woah oh oh oh
You smile, I smile
Hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile
I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
