Uh, my mind's filled with minefields
The ashes fall, the wine spills
The world stops, drops and rolls
It's Judgment Day or a fire drill
Yeah, I pour out my heart, have a drink
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lying
Yeah, my country tis of thee
Sweet land of kill 'em all and let 'em die

God bless America, uh
This so Godless America
Heard tomorrow ain't promised today
The end of time is like a hour away

Damn, military minded, lost it can't find it
The stars on the flag are never shining
Uh, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?
Cause I live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was looking for me, I'ma hide by abroad
Shooting stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I'm wired off a socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life, but not the lead
If there's food for thought then I'm guilty of greed
Mama said take what you want, I took heed, yeah
My little breed, yeah

Back to life, back to reality
Been eating my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity
But what's appealing to me is under banana trees, Lord
I go so hard, I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged
Ain't that a bitch? I'm just a nut tryna bust a nut in the nut shell
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail
Uh, same shit, different air freshener
I don't play boy, I ain't Hugh Hefner
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind
Two fingers to my head, pow, peace of mind
I be in a cloud, cloud number 9
And I just fucked a clock and let it cum in time
It's a cold world, I put on a mink
There's a chain of commands, I'm the missing link

Yeah, God bless America
This so Godless America
I heard tomorrow ain't promised today
And I'm smoking on them flowers, catch the bouquet

And we live by the sword and die by the sword
Heard police was looking for me, I'ma hide by abroad
Shooting stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket
I'm wired off a socket, but still shocking
Everybody wanna tell me what I need
You can play a role in my life, but not the lead
Yeah, I saw a butterfly in hell today
Will I die or go to jail today?---Lyrics submitted by Cruz Campa.
