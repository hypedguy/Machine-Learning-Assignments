Sitting here, all alone watching the snow fall
Looking back at the days we threm them snow balls
I can't believe I'm putting the tree up by myself
I need you and nobody else

And I'm sorry if I pushed you away
Cuz I need you here
And I want for you to know

And I don't care If I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
this christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I want is you

This christmas (I'm sorry)
This christmas (if I hurt you)
This christmas  (but I know that)
All I want is you this christmas

And I never wanna do this alone 
Baby I just need you to be here
Here through the holidays (yeah)

I just wanna know if you feel the same way
Because I'm I onely baby
Want you to hold me baby

And I'm sorry  if I pushed you away
I just want you yo know I miss you
And I want you to stay


And I don't care If I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
this christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I want is you

This christmas (I'm sorry)
This christmas (if I hurt you)
This christmas  (but I know that)
All I want is you this christmas

Wrapping gets without you babe
It's like mid december and there's no cold
I can't do this on my own oh ooh
I've changed my ways
keep running back and forth again
I'm here to stay

And I don't care If I don't get anything
All I need is you here right now
And I'm sorry if I hurt you
But I know that all I want is you
this christmas, this christmas, this christmas
All I want is you

This christmas (I'm sorry)
This christmas (if I hurt you)
This christmas  (but I know that)
All I want is you this christmas---Lyrics submitted by Selena Lautner.
