[Intro]
You know technically im not even realy supposed to be here right now
so Fuck it I might as well do the most of it
(Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen) [repeated]
Feels Good
Guess Im lucky
some of us dont get a second chance
But I aint blowin this one
Naah man haha
shit I feel like I can do it again now

Cinderella Man (x4)

Who can catch lighting in a bottle, set fire to water
Comin out the nozzle on a fire hose, cry it and swallow

Cinderella Man (x4)

Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, takes his hands and cup em
Spin around to freeze a clock, take the hands of time and cuff em

Cinderella Man (x4)

[Eminem - Verse 1]
There's a storm comin that the weatherman couldn't predict
I've start to ball prick you better flea cuz I get ticked
it's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up, I'm back to punch ya to the ground ya trick
It's a trap, fuck my last CD that shit's in my trash
I'll be God damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in a blink of an eye, so betcha I'll last
So keep winkin and blowin kisses cuz ur flirtin with death
I'm destroyin ur livelihood, I ain't just hurtin ur rep
I catch a flow and get goin,
No remorse, I'm showin they slowin, for no one, knowin there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroin in on my target like a marksman, the target is you
I'll shut your lane down, if you can spot the parked in at 2
Arsenic flower, lighter fluid, saliva, what can you do

Go get ur crew, hype you up, stand behind you like "woooooooo"
That boy's hot enough to melt hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate him, he don't blame you, frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how bout you?
Now guess who....(Hey)
Here's a clue....(Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater, lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
Now, what's his name

Cinderella Man (x4)

[Singing]
If I had a time machine
I'd be...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Music is my time machine
So call me...

Cinderella Man (x4)

[Eminem]
Fuck catchin lighting, he struck it
Screamed shut up at thunder
Then flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Cinderella Man (x4)

Rewound the future to the present
Paused it, don't ask how
Fuck the past motherfucker he's the shit right now
he's...

Cinderella Man (x4)

Cinderella man sent to fell Shady dey
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane
Raise hell from hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with this Cinderella story,
nor did he come to do the same, or can't afford to be a lamo in this day and age
And at this stage in the game, mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say bye to the old H-I to the new Que Sera
Consider it his last hurrah
The coupe de gras, raise em high, in the sky
People are tryin to bring this place alive
Thanks for bein patient I will make no more mistakes,
shit my Potatoes baked homie the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smokin weed, yea faggot the stakes are high
Shit I ain't even supposed to be here by the grace of God
By the skin of my teeth and the hair on my nuts I skated by
Now ya'll are on in ice with ankle weights I hate to lie
Now how fuckin irritated are you, how much in ur face am I
And there ain't shit you can do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit and I'm a spittin image I mirror it
When I stand near it, ur pussy lyric I couldn't hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists
Who? (Hey)
Here's a clue (Hey)
He came to the ball in his wife beater and lost his nike shoe
It's in ur ass, he's in ur ass, he's all up in ur psyche too
now...what's his name

[Chorus]
