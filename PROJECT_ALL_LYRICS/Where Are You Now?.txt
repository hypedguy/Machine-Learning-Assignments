Ohh, Ohh,
Ohhh woah...
oohhhh...

Where are you now?
When I need you the most
Why don't you take my hand?
I wanna be close.

Help me when I am down
Lift me up off the ground,
Teach me right from wrong.
Help me to stay strong.

So, take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be,
I need you to set me free Yeah

Where are you now...
Where are you now? 
Now that I'm half grown
Why are we far apart? 
I feel so alone.

Where are you now?
When nothing's going right
Where are you now?
I can't see the light.

So, take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be,
I need you to set me free Yeah, Yeah

I need you, to need me
Can't you see me
How could you leave me?
My heart is half empty
I'm not a whole when your not with me.

I want you here with me,
To guide me,
To hold me, and love me now

Where are you now...
oooohh...

Where are you now?
ooooo...
So, take my hand and walk with me.
Show me what to be,
I need you to set me free Yeah, yeah

Oh...
Where are you now?
Ohh...

Yeah, yeah...
oh, oh...
yeaaah.---Lyrics submitted by Michelle.
