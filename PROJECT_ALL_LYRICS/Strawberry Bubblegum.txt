This goes out to you...

Dedicated to you you you

Dedicated to you

Pretty lady
When you walk by
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow, mellow day

Listen
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
And then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it's pure just by the taste
When you kiss me

So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

Cause she's just like nothing
That I've ever seen before,
Baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original

And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey... smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey... popping that strawberry bubblegum

This goes out to you
This goes out to you

So tell why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
Cause you shouldn't wanna work here anyway
And baby I, I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me, best of recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way

Tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor cause I love the taste, love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way

Cause she's just like nothing
That I've ever seen before,
And baby please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original

And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey... smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey... popping that strawberry bubblegum

My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
She's my little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
Hey, hey, hey
My little
Hey, hey, hey

Come in, sit down
Let me elevate your appetite
Any flavor you want
Now my selection is the tasty kind
But you, you're delicious on your own
After I break you down my fingers
You're so sweet
That's what you told me when I taste on your lips
Towel under the door
Girl before they pick up your scent
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop
Hey, hey, hey

My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum
My little strawberry strawberry strawberry bubblegum

If you'd be strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl won't you be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I'll make you pop
Strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
Little girl if you'd be my strawberry bubblegum
Then I'd be your blueberry lollipop
And then I'd love you 'til I make you pop---
