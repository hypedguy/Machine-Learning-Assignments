Baby I will not pout
Baby I will not cry
Cause I got your love this Christmas time.
When the snow's on the ground
And it's freezing outside
I got your love this Christmas time.

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest, warm me up
With your Christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one for my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas Love

Like a beautiful tree, you can light up the room
But your kind of star can't be removed
Like a beautiful carol, I get lost in your song
And I will forever sing along

On every list I've ever sent
You're the gift I'd love the best
So deck the halls and all the rest, warm me up
With your Christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one for my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love

All the lovers round the world
(All the lovers round the world)
I can sing you Merry, Merry Christmas
Merry Merry Christmas
(And Happy Holidays)
And every boy and every girl
Stay close to the ones you love
And thank God above
That you got someone this year
That can fill your heart with cheer

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one for my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love

Hey angel in the snow
I'm under the mistletoe
You are the one for my very own Christmas love
Tell Santa I'm cool this year
My present is standing right here
Thank God above for my very own Christmas love

(For my very own Christmas love
For my very own Christmas love
Give me a kiss, baby
Give me a kiss, baby)---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
