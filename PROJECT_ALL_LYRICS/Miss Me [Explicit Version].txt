[Drake]
I said tell me whats really going on
Drizzy back up in this thing Im ready, whats happenin?
Gone for surgery but now Im back again
Im bout my paper like a muhfuckin scratch and win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife your bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice
(Drake you got em right?) Yeah I got em Bun
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun
Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
yeah, Im in the city of the purple sprite
someone tell Maliah Im on fire she should work tonight
call up King of Diamonds and tell China itd be worth the flight
Ill be at my table stacking dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin twerk somethin basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin naked
I dont judge her, I dont judge her but I could never love her
Cause to her Im just a rapper and soon shell have met another
Thats why me and Lil Jazz bout to spaz can you keep up?
Im just feeling sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
and D.R.A.K.E. just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her Id admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin did it
And girl Im fuckin serious Im with it if you with it
Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted
Uh, damn, I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch em stealing flows cause I swear I never loaned it
And life aint a rehearsal, the cameras always rollin
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin

[Hook]
Cause its on, yeah girl its on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when Im gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when Im gone

[Lil Wayne]
Oooh sh-t, muthafucka Goddamn 
kickin bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin money everyday Ima ground hog
Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I dont piss the ground off
man I swear my bitches do it til they suck the brown off
Ugh, thats nasty
Yes I am Weezy but I aint asthmatic
They buyin cologne, honey I put on
Make em run and tell their friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Moneys Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
when she masturbates to me, thats how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when Im gone
no Im not that thuggish not that ruggish but I do pack bone
Uhh, Im a love machine, and I wont work for nobody but you
Its only me and her cause the Bugatti a Coupe
Its blood gang slob, but Im prolly wit Snoop
I aint lyin I shoot, you dont need science for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin in soup
And when Im in the booth, bitch the lion is loose
Man I got so many styles, I am a group
Damn, Ill be gone til November
But fuck it I aint trippin, I know Drizzy gon kill em
Im stickin to the script like lint on denim
Momma say if the rules aint bent dont bend em
Real nigga talking, shut the fuck up hoe
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up Zoe
Weezy F Baby and the F is for front door
Cause thats where I brang it, Soo Woo if you bangin mothafucka

[Hook]
Yeah girl its on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when Im gone
Yeah I hope that you miss me a little when Im gone---Lyrics submitted by Jason.
