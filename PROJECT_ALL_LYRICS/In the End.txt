All brawn and no brains
And all of those nice things, you finally got what you want
Someone to look good with and light your cigarette
Is that really what you want?

I figured out what you're all about and
I don't think I like what I see
So...I hope I won't be there in the end if you come around

How long will he last
Before he's a creep in the past
And you're alone once again?
Will you pop up again and be my "special friend"
Til the end, and when will that be?

I figured out what you're all about and
I don't think I like what I see
So...I hope I won't be there in the end if you come around

Hey!

I figured out what you're all about and
I don't think I like what I see
So...I hope I won't be there in the end if you come around---Lyrics submitted by Max Pierce.
