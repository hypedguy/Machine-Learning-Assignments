Seventeen and stung out on confusion
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion
I found out what it take to be a man
mom and dad will never understand

Secrets collecting dust but never forget
Skeletons come to life in my closet
I found out what it takes to be a man
mom and dad will never understand
Whats happening to me!

Seventeen and coming clean for the first time 
I finally figured out myself for the first time
I found out what it takes to be a man
mom and dad will never understand
Whats happening to me!---Lyrics submitted by michael.
