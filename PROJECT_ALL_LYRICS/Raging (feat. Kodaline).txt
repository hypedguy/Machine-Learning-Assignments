Standing in the cold in the frozen wind
I'm leaving you behind but it's not the end
No, no, no
Walking on a plane as I hold my breath
It's gonna be weeks 'til I breathe again
No, no, no

I know that you hate it
And I hate it
Just as much as you
But if you can brave it
I can brave it
Brave it all for you

Call me anytime you can see the lightning
Don't you be alone, you can always find me
We've got our wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our eyes keep trading places
We've got our wild love raging, raging

Raging, raging
Raging, raging
Raging, raging

Checking into hotel loneliness
It's not what I've been used to, I confess
So wake up three times a night
Talking to a stranger is nothing new
She knows how to smile but not like you
So I wait for you all night

I know that you hate it
And I hate it
Just as much as you
But if you can brave it
I can brave it
Brave it all for you

Call me anytime you can see the lightning
Don't you be alone, you can always find me
We've got our wild love raging, raging
Lost among a million changing faces
Every day our eyes keep trading places
We've got our wild love raging, raging---
