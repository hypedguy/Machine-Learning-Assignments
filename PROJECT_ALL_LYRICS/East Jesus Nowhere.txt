Raise your hands to testify
Your confession will be crucified
You're a sacrificial suicide
Like a dog that's been sodomized
Stand up! - all the white boys
Sit down! - all the black girls
You're the soldiers of the new world

Put your faith in a miracle
And it's non-denominational
Join the choir we will be singing
In the church of wistful thinking

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Oh bless me Lord for I have sinned
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed
I threw my crutches in "the river
Of a shadow of doubt"
And I'll be dressed in my sunday best

Say a prayer for the family
Drop a coin for humanity
Ain't this uniform so flattering?
I never asked you a goddamned thing

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics

Don't test me
Second guess me
Protest me
You will disappear

I want to know who's allowed to breed
All the dogs who never learned to read
Missionary politicians
And the cops of a new religion

A fire burns today
Of blasphemy and genocide
The sirens of decay
Will infiltrate the inside---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
