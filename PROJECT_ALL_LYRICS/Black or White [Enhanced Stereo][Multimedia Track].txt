I took my baby
On a Saturday night
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight

But, If
You're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black Or White

They print my message
In The Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
An it's true
Either you're wrong
Or you're right

But, if
You're thinkin'
About my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black Or White

I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the
Going gets rough
I ain't scared of
Your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody
Girl when the
Goin' gets mean

[L. T. B. Rap Performance]
Protection
For gangs, clubs
And nations
Causing grief in
Human relations
It's a turf war
On a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides
Of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood
Comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright
Get duller
I'm not going to spend
My life being a color

[Michael]
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt In my eye

But, if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black Or White

I said if
You're thinkin' of
Being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

I said if
You're thinkin' of
Being my brother
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

Ooh, Ooh
Yea, Yea, Yea Now
Ooh, Ooh
Yea, Yea, Yea Now

It's Black, It's White
It's tough for you
To get by
It's Black , It's White, Whoo

It's Black, It's White
It's tough for you
To get by
It's Black , It's White, Whoo
