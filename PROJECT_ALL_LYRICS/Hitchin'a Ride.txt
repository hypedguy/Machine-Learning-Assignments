Hey mister, where you headed? 
Are you in a hurry? 
I need a lift to happy hour 
Say oh no.

Do you brake for distilled spirits? 
I need a break as well 
The well that inibriates the guilt.
1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

Cold turkey's getting stale
Tonight I'm eating crow 
Fermented salmonella poison, oh no 

There's a drought at the fountain of youth, and now I'm dehydrated
My tongue is swelling up, I say 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4

Troubled times, you know I can not lie 
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

There's a drought at the fountain of youth, and now I'm dehydrated
My tongue is swelling up, I say shit!

Troubled times, you know I can not lie 
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride 

I'm hitchin' a ride
I'm hitchin' a ride
I'm hitchin' a ride
I'm hitchin' a ride
I'm hitchin' a ride
I'm hitchin' a ride
I'm hitchin' a ride
I'm hitchin' a ride---Lyrics submitted by duck.
