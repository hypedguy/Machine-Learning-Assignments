Beautiful days are long gone 
I can't seem to breath 
Feels like it hasn't been that long 
Since you walked away from me 

Now I can try to act real strong 
But you and I both know 
I still think of you that way 
You should know that 

Beautiful lights, the star filled nights 
They don't mean a thing 
'Cuz you are my star 
So it don't seem right without you here with me 

Now I can try to act real strong 
But you and I both know 
It's hard for me to say 
You were my soul 

Now I could say that I don't love you no more 
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love 
And I can tell you I feel it's time for us to go our seperate ways 
But baby I just wouldn't be the same 'cuz girl your love is still on my brain 

Now when you're in love, it takes time to heal 
When someone's broken your heart it changes how you feel 
Girl I, thought that you would never do me that way 
But even after all I still think of you that way 

Now I could say I don't love you no more 
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love 
And I can tell you I feel it's time for us to go our seperate ways 
But baby I just wouldn't be the same 'cuz girl your love is still on my brain 

Now love is a game that we both like to play 
Will I win or lose if I go or if I stay, yeah? 
Even though I tried to hide my broken hearted side 
Girl you know me inside out and I can't get you off of my mind 

Now I could say I don't love you no more 
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love 
And I can tell you I feel it's time for us to go our seperate ways 
But baby I just wouldn't be the same, girl your love is still on my brain
