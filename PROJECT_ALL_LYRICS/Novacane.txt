I think I started something, 
I got what I wanted 
did didn't I can't feel nothing 
Superhuman, even when i'm fucking 
Viagra popping, every single record 
Auto-tuning, zero emotion, muted emotion 
Phish corrected 
Computed emotion uh huh 

I blame it on a model broad with the hollywood smile 
Oww, stripper booty and rack like wow 
Brain like berkeley 
Met her at Coachella, I went to see Jigga 
She went to see z-trip 
Perfect, I took a seat on the ice cold lawn 
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever 

She said she wanna be dentist really badly 
She's in school paying, for tuition doing porn in the valley 
At least she working 

But girl i can't feel my face 
What are we smoking anyway 
She said don't let the high go to waste 
But can you taste, a little taste a.. 

Novocaine 
Baby, Baby 
Novocaine baby i want you, 
Fuck me good, Fuck me long, Fuck me numb 
Love me now when i'm gone love me none 
Love me none, love me none 
Numb numb numb numb 

Sink full a dishes 
Pacing in the kitchen 
Cocaine for breakfast, Yikes 
Bed full of women 
Flip on a tripod 
little red light on shooting, I'm feeling like 
Stanley Kubrick 
This is some visionary shit 
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut 
But it keeps on moving... 

I blame it on a model broad with the hollywood smile 
Stripper booty with the rack like wow 
I'll never forget ya 
You put me on a feel that i never had, never had, never had 
and ever since I've been tryna get it back, and pick it up, and put it back 

Now i'm something like the chemist on campus 
But there's no drug around 
Quite like what i found in you you 

I still can't feel my face (oh-oh) 
What am i smoking anyway (ah-ah) 
She said don't let the high go to waste 
But can you taste, a little taste a... 

Novocaine , baby baby 
Novocaine baby i want you 
Fuck me good 
Fuck me long 
Fuck me numb 
Love me now when i'm gone love me none 
Love me none love me none 
numb numb numb numb 

Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine ... 
Numb the pain, numb the pain 
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain... 
Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine, Novocaine... 
For the pain, for the pain... 
Novocaine, novocaine 

(Singing) 

Pretty girls involved with me 
Making pretty love to me, pretty 
Pity, pity 
All the pretty girls involved with me 
Making pretty love to me, pretty 
Pity, pity 

Ooh ooh, I can't feel a thing 
I can't feel, can't feel a thing 

Can't feel a thing 
Can't feel feel feel feel her 
I Can't feel feel her 
Novocaine Novacaine Novocaine 
I can't feel feel her 
Novocaine, for the pain, for the pain 

I can't feel feel her (feel her, feel her) 
Ooh, Novocaine Novocaine (caine, caine...)---Lyrics submitted by timyah.
