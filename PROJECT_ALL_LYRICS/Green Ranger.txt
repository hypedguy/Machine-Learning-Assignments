Verse 1:
You know I've been talking shit for a generation now
It's about that time for me to kick my feet up
You know?
Move on to other in-devours 
Who's read to take the torch?
Somebody?..... Anybody?.... 
Haven't I taught you anything?

Verse 2: (J Cole)
When this shit dropped I was about 16
Trynna get some head from a mixed thing
Big Dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans

Nigga gotta job
Had my lil' wallet
Worse fear was gettin' robbed
For my last 50 dollars that I had left over

5 dollars and they pop a nigga in his left shoulder 
Minimum wage 5.15
13s on my whip kept my shit clean
Actually that was my momma's shit

but i driving around down on my Obama shit
Middle class my ass
Just to get a tank of gas
Hadda run the guns up the street and pawn the shit

But yeah I headed for a scholarship 
Little scrap game but i gotta alotta lip
Thats why those niggas dont like me 
And always wanna fight me

A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth most likely
I know the game I'm a expert
Nigga, How you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I'm gone

Showed up at her crib trynna bone
And I fucked yet cause her momma always home
God... Damn
La-Lord have mercy

Please God, Don't let this little broad have herpes
My niggas say she fast like jackies on a curb street
Gold medals, if we gave hoes medals 
No rose pettles on the bed in the ghettos

Spider-Man sheets 
Gotta sing for a set of thoses 
Tall white T's cant believe we used to wear those
White folks looking at us like we weirdos 

But we was only kiddos
Grabbin' titties in the club
Pocket fulla skittle
Trynna get the kitty was like trynna solve a riddle

Trynna get the diddy cause I murder instrumentals 
That's that good ol' fashion Mark Jackson 
Fucked and I passed now you all Utah Jazzin'
You borin' 

I dont play nigga I Mark Madison
Thats why my knots stick like a fuckin' Kardasian 
I'm not asking my nigga I dont need favors
I'm in the streets with the fiends 
I've done and seen danger

My teenager 
We party like teenagers
I'm in the green range
Nigga I'm the green ranger

I fucking ran outta breathe 
Teenager 
We party like teenagers

I'm in the green range 
Nigga I'm the green ranger

Verse 3:(Lil' Wayne)
I don't even like this beat

But fuck it... I'm only gonna spit a few bars cause I don't like this beat

Bitch I'm not old news
I'm more like Gold Shoes
She eat my whole dick
She like whole foods 

They say I'm old school
But I dropped out
Drop your body off
At a cops house 

They throwing up them bricks
You better box out
My niggas got enough life 
To build Barack's house

I got my draws on Sam Rastein 
44 on my waist Rick Ross Jeans
I've been faded, Stone-washed jeans

New pussy, new money, New Orleans 
50 up in the Uzi 
G-G-G-G-unit
I merk you with that bitch scratch the serial number and reuse it

I'm from the N.O.
Stretch niggas out like limos 
That Uzi goes
Zit Zit Zit Zit Zit
Thats pimples, Uh

I'm abouta go bananas puddin'
You a dike cause your man a pussy
Hit you from the blind side no Sandra Bullock 
Never bite the hand that feeds you always watch the hand thats cookin', Tunchi 

Hahaha, Yeah Man

Shout out Cole 
You already know what it is

Cole World, Wayne's World
We in this bitch hoe
Special Delivery 
At yo front door

Hahahahaha Red Bow BEE-OUTCH---Lyrics submitted by Derek.
