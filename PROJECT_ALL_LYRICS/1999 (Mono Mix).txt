1999 was a good year
I was born, and then I died
So fill your glasses to the brim
And drink the whiskey and the gin

So come on in
Have a drink and be merry
In this house there is plenty of wine
Come on in 
Have a drink and some sherry
And drink your drinks to 1999

Do you hear the grassland saying
No nations gratefully receive
So fill your glasses to the brim
And drink the whiskey and the gin

So come on in
Have a drink and be merry
In this house there is plenty of wine
Come on in 
Have a drink and some sherry
And drink your drinks to 1999

1999 was a good year
I was born, and then I died
So fill your glasses to brim
And drink to 1999
And drink to 1999
And here's to 1999
And drink to 1999
And here's to 1999
And cheers to 1999---Lyrics submitted by Logan Sharkey.
