Something's on my mind
It's been for quite some time
It's time I'm onto you
So where's the other face?
The face I heard before
You're head trip's boring me

Let's nuke the bridge we've torched
Two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching out to say

Stuck down in a rut
Against logic and sput
A side of you well-hid
But it's all said and done
It's real and it's been fun
But was it all real fun?

Let's nuke the bridge we've torched
Two thousand times before
This time we'll blast it all to hell
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching out to say, say...

You're just a fuck
I can't explain it
Cause I think you suck
I'm taking pride
In telling you to fuck off and die

I've had this burning in my guts now for so long
My belly's aching out to say
I'm taking pleasure in the doubts..........
So listen up into my........

Goodbye!!!!---Lyrics submitted by Dana.
