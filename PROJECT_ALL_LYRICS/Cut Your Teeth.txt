(feat. Kyla La Grange)

Didn't I warn you not to?
Didn't I warn you good?
Maybe we couldn't help it.
Maybe we never should.

Didn't I say it slowly?
Didn't I make it clear?
Is it unfair to ask you?
Why it is you're still here?

You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, and you,
Come back home and it don't feel the same,
Well I bled words onto a page for you,
And you never knew my name.

Didn't I make it harder?
Didn't I leave you there?
Was it too much to ask you?
Why it is you still care?

You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, and you,
Come back home and it don't feel the same,
Well I bled words onto a page for you,
And you never knew my name.

Come, go, break your bones,
They cut you up and never let go.
Swing low, play your show,
Call your mother say take me home.
Lights, smoke, don't say no,
You're another man down if you let them know.

You cut your teeth on the lack of answers, and you,
Come back home and it don't feel the same,
Well I bled words onto a page for you,
And you never knew my name.---
