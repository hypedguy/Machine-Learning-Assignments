[Verse 1:]
Things been so crazy and hected
I should of have got back by now
But you know how much I wanted to make it
It's probably better any how...

[Bridge:]
So if you gotta go
If there's anythin I should know
If the spotlight makes you nervous
If you looking for a purpose

[Verse 2:]
You put the tea in the kettle and light it
Put your hand on the metal and feel it
But do you even feel it anymore
I remember when you thought I was joking
Now I'm all singing karaoke, further than I ever been

[Bridge:]
So if you gotta go...
If there's anyway I can help

[Verse 3: Rap]
Isn't it ironic,
That the girl I wanna marry is a wedding planner
And tell's me my life is to much and moves to atlanta
Damn, of all the places you could go
I just thought you would choose some where that had somebody that you know
I'm alway's up to late
I worry bout you there alone in a place you call your home warm nights and cold patron
I hope you don't get known for nothing crazy cause no man wants to hear those stories bout his lady
I know they say the first love is the sweetest but the first cut is the deepest
I tryed to keep us together you was busy keeping secrets
Secrets you would tell everybody but me
Don't be fooled by the money
I'm still just young and unlucky
I'm suprise you couldn't tell

[Bridge:]
I was only trying to get ahead [x2]
But the spotlight makes you nervous
And your looking for a purpose


I was only trying to get ahead [x2]
But the spotlight makes you nervous...---Lyrics submitted by kari.
