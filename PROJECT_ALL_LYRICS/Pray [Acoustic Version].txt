oh oh oh-oh-oh *3 in my mind

VERSE ONE
i just cant sleep tonight knowing that this aint right
its in the papers its on the tv its everywhere that i go
children are crying soldiers are dying some people dont have a home 
and i know there's sunshine behind the rain i know theres good times behind that pain 
can u tell me how i can make a change 

CHORUS
i close my eyes and i can see a better day 
i close my eyes and i pray 
(2 times)

VERSE TWO
i lose my appetite knowing kids starve tonight 
am i a sinner cuz all my dinner is still in my plate 
oooo i got a vision to make a difference and its starting today 
 i know there's sunshine behind the rain i know theres good times behind that pain 
heaven tell me how to make a change 

CHORUS 
i close my eyes and i can see a better day 
i close my eyes and i pray 
(2 times)

VERSE THREE
i pray for the broken hearted 
i pray for the life not started
i pray for all the ones not breathing
i pray for all the souls that need a prayer
can u give em one today ??
i just cant sleep tonight 
can someone tell me how to make a change

CHORUS 
i close my eyes and i can see a better day 
i close my eyes and i pray 
(2 times)
i praaaaaaaaayyyy (*2)
i close my eyes and i prayyyy---Lyrics submitted by quanzella.
