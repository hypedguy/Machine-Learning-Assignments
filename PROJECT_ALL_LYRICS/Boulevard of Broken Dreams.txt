I walk a lonely road,
The only one that I have ever known.
Don't know where it goes,
But it's home to me and I walk alone.


I walk this empty street,
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
Where the city sleeps,
And I'm the only one and I walk alone.


I walk alone,
I walk alone. 

(Chorus)
I walk alone, I walk a-
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me.
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me,
'til then I, walk alone...

Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah...Ahh...
Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah...


I'm walking down the line,
that divides me somewhere in my mind.
On the border line, of the edge in where,
I walk alone.


There between the lies,
What's f***ed up,
And everything's all right.
Check my vital signs, no,
I'm still alive, and I walk alone.


I walk alone,
I walk alone...


(Chorus)


Ah ah, ah ah, ah ah...Ahh...
Ah ah, ah ah, I walk alone, 
I walk a-


I walk this empty street,
on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams.
Where the city sleeps, and I'm the 
only one.


I walk a-
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me.
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating.
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me,
'til then I, walk alone...---Lyrics submitted by Sarah Winters.
