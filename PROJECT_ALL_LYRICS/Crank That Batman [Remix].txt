now watch me step it out 
we fresh when we be stepping out 
we still get low then stop and boat 
yeah we one two step it out 
[aye] you cant do it like I do it so just take a seat 
[aye] watch me kill my dance as im jiggin to the beat 
You they like da way I do it and they like the way I move it 
so they ask me was my dance 
and I just say that its the movement 
that's your song girl so gone and juke with it 
now get boggie on the floor now one two with it

now watch me peanut butter jelly with a baseball bat (2x) 
now bring it back because they aint seen that[mix] (2x)

You throw your dance at me im going to eat it up 
like pac man hold on wait a minute 
[watch me crank my batman] 
I lean 2 the right

I don't need nobody help 
Because I can jig it by myself 
Because im still bouncing then I stop and let my shoulder lean 
still bouncing then I stop and let me should lean

Now watch me crank my batman[2x] 
Now get boggie on da floor Now one two wit it[2x]
