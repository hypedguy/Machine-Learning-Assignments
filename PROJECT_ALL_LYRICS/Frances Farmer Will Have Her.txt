It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me, it's startin to sound the same

[Chorus]
I miss the comfort in being sad (3)

In her false witness, I hope you're still with us to see if they float or drown
My favorite patient, a display of patience, disease covered puget sound
She'll come back as fire and burn all the liars, leave a blanket of ash on the ground

[Chorus] (3)

It's so relieving to know that you're leaving as soon as you get paid
It's so relaxing to hear that you're asking whenever you get your way
It's so soothing to know that you'll sue me, it's startin to sound the same

[Chorus] (3)---Lyrics submitted by Sergio.
