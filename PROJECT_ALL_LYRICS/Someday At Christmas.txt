Someday at Christmas
men won't be boys.
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys.
One warm December,
our hearts will see
a world where men are free.

Someday at Christmas
there will be no wars.
When we have learned what Christmas is for.
When we have found true light in a world,
there will be peace on earth.

Someday all our dreams will come to be.
Someday in a world where men are free.
Maybe not in time for you and me,
but someday at Christmas time.

Someday at Christmas
we'll see a man.
No hungry children and no empty hands.
One happy morning people will share
a world where people care.

Someday at Christmas
there will be no tears.
All men are equal and no men have fears.
One sunny morning, my heart ran away
from our world today.

Someday all our dreams will come to be.
Someday in a world where men are free.
Maybe not in time for you and me,
but someday at Christmas time.

Someday at Christmas
man will not fail.
Take hope because your love will prevail.
Someday a new world where we can start,
with hope in every heart.

Someday all our dreams will come to be.
Someday in a world where men are free.
Maybe not in time for you and me,
but someday at Christmas time.

Someday at Christmas time.---Lyrics submitted by evanforaker.
