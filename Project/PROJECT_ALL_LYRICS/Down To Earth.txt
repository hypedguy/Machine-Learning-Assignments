I never thought it would be easy
Cause we're both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

(Refrain)
So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry (and cry and cry and cry)
And we live (and we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you 
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)

Mommy you were always somewhere
And daddy I live outta town
So tell me how i can ever be normal somehow
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears
So far away and now i just need you

(Refrain)
So we fight (so we fight)
Through the hurt (through the hurt)
And we cry (and cry and cry and cry)
And we live ( and we live)
And we learn (and we learn)
And we try and try and try and try
So its up to you 
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)
(back down to earth)

We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go
When there's no road
to get to your heart
Let's start over again

So its up to you 
and its up to me
That we meet in the middle 
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth
Down to earth
On our way back down to earth

I never thought it would be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wonder how...---Lyrics submitted by Sydneye.
