(feat. Timbaland)

[Spoken: Timbaland]
[4x]
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo

Lights out, TKO

[Verse 1:]
Baby, everyday you're training to get the gold
That's why your body's crazy
But you can't run from yourself,
That's where it's difficult

Girl I can see in your eyes
That there's something inside
That made you evil
Where did you go,
'cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you say
Don't know why it gets to me

[Bridge:]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus:]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Post-Chorus:]
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

[Verse 2:]
Baby, now I don't really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins if somebody's heart is swole
'Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go, it just ain't fair
Over here thinking 'bout the shit you do
Don't know what I got to lose

[Bridge:]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus:]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO

[Post-Chorus:]
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO

[Spoken: Timbaland]
Girl, see what you do
See what you do, girl?
You, you, you knock me right out
Girl, see what you do
See what you do, girl, girl, girl, girl...
You knock me right out
Hey girl
Girl, see what you do
See what you do, girl, girl, girl, girl...
You knock me right out
Hey girl
Girl, see what you do
See what you do, girl, girl, girl, girl...
You knock me right out

[Bridge:]
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?

[Chorus:]
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low
You've been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO, TKO, TKO

TKO, TKO

I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low
You've been swinging after the bell
And after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below my belt, through my chest
Perfect hit to the dome, dammit babe

Dammit babe, dammit babe
Dammit babe, dammit babe
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dammit, babe

Kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with that coo, so dammit babe
Dammit babe, dammit babe
Dammit babe, dammit babe
Dammit, babe
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dammit, babe

She kill me with that coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with that coo, so dammit babe
Dammit babe, dammit babe
Dammit babe, dammit babe
Dammit, babe
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-dammit, babe

So, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO, T-TKO ---
