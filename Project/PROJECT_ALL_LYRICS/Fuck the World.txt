Who you callin rapist
Aint that a bitch you devils are so two faced 
Wanna see me lock'd in chains
Dropped in shame 
And gettin sock'd by you crooked cops again
Fucking with the young black male tryna stack bail
And stay away from them pack jails
I told told the judge im in danger
And thats why I had that 4-5 with one in the chamber

Chrous: Fuck the world( they tryna say that I dont care)
Woke up and screamed fuck the world( they tryna say that I dont care)
Just woke up and screamed fuck the world( they tryna say that I dont care)
I woke up and screamed fuck the world( they tryna say that I dont care)
Just got up and screamed fuck the world

When I was comin up rough that wasnt even what you call it 
That why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
Im gettin threats to me comin from my enemies 
And in they dream its hell where they sending me
Have i lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sipping on yack as I sit back 
Life is as a big mack
Brothers come up and say you did that 
Never take your eyes off the prize
Even if you getting high don't never hesiatate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin
Niggas we all in and then my mother fucking callin

Repeat chrous

They wanna label me a menace
Because i'm sittin here sippin on genis
Weightin 165 and these tricks should die 
For being jealouy of a brother when he rides
I can see it in your eyes 
You wanna see a young playa fallin
They hate to see a nigga ballin
Some of you suckas is bustas
Plottin on what I got and you wonder why I shot em'
Stop giving game for free
You wanna hang with me like being a thug is the thang to be
But I got love for my homies the G's and macks 
And if your black you betta stay straped
Nigga fuck the world

Repeat Chrous

They wanna know if I claim the click that im hangin with
And if i'm down with this bangin shit
But homie I dont give a fuck if your blood or cuz
Long as you got love for thugs
But dont try and test me out
Stall that homie this is thug life 
And we all straped
We then been to hell and back 
And if I fell black its back to the corners where we sell crack
Some of you niggas are bustas
You runnin round with them tramp ass bitches 
Don't trust her
But dont cry the world aint prepared fo us
A straight thug motherfucker that aint scared to bust
Fuck the world

Repeat Chrous

I dont care
