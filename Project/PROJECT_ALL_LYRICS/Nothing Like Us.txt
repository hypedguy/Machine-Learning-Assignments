Lately I've been thinking
Thinking about what we had
I know it's hard
It was all that we knew
Yeah

Have you been drinking to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
'Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do

You know there's no one I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together

I gave you everything, babe
Everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away?
Yeah

Lost in confusion
Like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day
But that is the past now
We didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be

Tell me was it worth it?
We were so perfect
Baby, I just want you to see

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together 

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together---Lyrics submitted by Slendah man.
