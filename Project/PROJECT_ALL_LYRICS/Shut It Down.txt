These girls aint got nothing on you
uhh, say baby I had to mention
that if you were a star youd be the one Im searching for
other girls they got attention
but I just always feel like there in need of something you got
obvious you're pretty
heard that your a student working weekends in the city
trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
and if theres nothing wrong, got this little song
for you to get ready to
put those f-cking heels on and work it girl
let that mirror show you what your doing
put that f-cking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebodys taking pictures

[Chorus]
shut it down down down
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it down down down
you be the baddest girl around round round
and they notice they notice
you would shut it, hey oh
these girls aint got nothing on you nothing on you

What you need
[The Dream]
I can be (I can be)
your everything
(who knew)
them other n-ggas
just wanna hit it but if they had it
wouldnt know what to do with it
(and together)

[Drake & The Dream]
we shut it down down down
they know we shut it down down down
your the baddest girl around

[The Dream]
TMZ concrete loop
you shut that muthf-cker down down
ice cream conversations they all want the scoop
you shut that muthaf-cker down down down
oh yeah,
yes indeed, you shut it down down
Drizzy, The American Dream

You shut that sh-t down
(down down down)
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it down
you shut it, ohh

you looking good girl
go go go get em girl,
go go go go hit em girl
go go go go go go
you shut it down---Lyrics submitted by timikka.
