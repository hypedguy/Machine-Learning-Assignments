Sound like my mic is right 

Ugh 
I am not a human 
Shout to all my moon men 
Daddy call me Tune 
Got them bitches tuned in 
It's a crazy world so I stay in mine 
And niggas don't cross the line 
Niggas stay in line 
Like welfare I stay elsewhere 
Hotter than a devil, nigga hell yeah 
Roc-a-bye baby, homocide baby 
That's more tear drops, call me Cry Baby 
What you talkin' 'bout? Tell it to my .9 
Cut your tongue out, mail it to your moms 
I'm a young god, swagga un-flawed 
Bitch I'm in the building, you in the front yard 
Life's a bitch, naw, better yet a dumb broad 
And I bet I can fuck the world and make it cum hard 
Yeah you boys is washed up 
And I'm shittin' on 'em, like two girls and one cup 
Weezy Baby aka bring the money home 
Pull out a AK and pop ya in ya funny bone 
Laugh now die later muthafucker 
You's a bitch like Zeta Phi Beta muthafucker 


Yeah, I call it how I see ya 
I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya 
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea 
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea 
Yeah, I call it how I see ya 
I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya 
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea 
Pussy ass nigga, I don't want your gonorrhea 


Man I'm so tired of ballin' I sleep a lot now 
I'll let my goons rush ya, like Moscow 
Gun at ya eyebrow pow pow 
Man I ball hard, even with five fouls 
Yeah we in this bitch, like tampons 
Dump ya in the woods, now get ya camp on 



Choke hold around this shit 'cause I'm so hands on 
I get high as fuck and Polo sheets is what I lands on 
Back against the wall and my two feet is what I stand on 
Diva in the room, she blowin' me just like a band horn 
Got her on her knees the same knees that she be prayin' on 
Now she just text her girlfriend with a capital, "You can join" 
Yeah, what y'all wanna do I'm all ears 
Smokin' on that head band call that shit that Paul Pierce 
I'm just so ahead of my time like dog years 
Ball like Solange, India Arie, Britney Spears 




I aaaaaam, spendin' much more than I'm makin' on these cars and these vacations 
Is that too much information? 
I just bought a Lamborghini, I'm not even into racin' 
With a windshield full of tickets 'cause I live right by the station 
I aaaaam, try'na figure out why you so mad at me 
Yes I'm with Young Money tell the magazine stop askin' me 
I be with the dread with the tattoos on his head 
And a flag the color red like a fuckin' low battery 
Nigga peep the shit I'm wylin' on 
I be with your baby momma you be with your child at home 
Big Mo, Big Red, two cups made of Styrofoam 
Big cheese, big bread, call that shit a calzone 
I will break yo' fuckin' collar bone 
Us agianst the world, better pick which fuckin' side you on 
Wayne got a Bugatti that he steady puttin' mileage on 
And we about to kill 'em, C4 Mr. Carter's home 


Yeah, I call it how I see ya 
I wish I never met ya, I wouldn't wanna be ya 
We some asshole niggas, call us diarrhea 
The money keep growin', yep 
It's growin' like a Chia 
Yeah, I call it how I see it 
Y'all some pussy ass niggas we should call ya gonorrhea 
Uh, you keep talkin' that shit I'ma see ya 
Kill ya senorita and and fuck ya mama mia---Lyrics submitted by Coty.
