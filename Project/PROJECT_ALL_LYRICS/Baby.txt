ooh waaaa
ooh waaaa
ohhh wohhhhhhhh
You know you love me
I know you care
Just shout when ever and I'll be there
You are my love
You are my heart
And we would never, ever, ever be apart

Are we an item?
Girl quit playnnnnn'
We're just friends, 
What are you saynnnnnn'
Take another look right in my eyes
My first love, broke my heart for the first time

And i was like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I thought you'd always be mine

ooooo oooooooo
For you, I would have done whatever
and i just can't believe we're not together
And I'm gatta' play it cool 
While I'm losin you
I'll buy you anything
I'll buy you any RING
Cause I'm in pieces
Baby fix me.              
baby shake me till you  wake me from this bad dream*
I'm goin down, down, down
and I just can't believe my first love won't be around

Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I thought you'd always be mine(mine)

You can give  all of your love
but sometimes it wont be enough
Neva told me this day would come
Now I'm all gone
You can give me all of your love
just this time it wont be enough
Neva told me this day would come

Cause I was like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I'm like
Baby, baby, baby noo
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Yeahh, yeah, yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone
