Have you seen my childhood? 
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me

They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause i keep kidding around like a child
But pardon me

People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary thing
Its in my fate to compensate 
For the childhood,I've never known

Have you seen my childhood
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me 
Try hard to love me
Look within your heart,then ask
Have you seen my childhood 

People say I'm not okay
Cause i love such elementary thing
Its in my fate to compensate
For the childhood,I've never known

Have you seen my childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams i would dare,watch me fly

Before you judge me
Try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had---Lyrics submitted by hildredann.
