I'm taking all you down with me
Explosive duct taped to my spine
Nothing's gonna change my mind

I won't listen to anyone's last words
There's nothin' left for you to say
Soon you'll be dead anyway

Well no one here, is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've meant
To me it's nothing (4 times)

I'm losing all my happiness
The happiness you pinned on me
My loneliness still comforts me
My anger dwells inside of me
I'm taking it all out on you for all the shit you put me through

Well no one here, is getting out alive
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care
So close your eyes
And kiss yourself goodbye
And think about the times you spent and what they've been
To me it's nothing (4 times)

Do you ever think back to another time ?
Does it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind ?
Do you ever want to lead a long trail of destruction and mow down
any bullshit that confronts you ?
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head
To make one problem that adds up to nothing

To me it's nothing (3 times)---Lyrics submitted by jose.
