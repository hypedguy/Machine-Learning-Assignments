I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock

[Lil Wayne]
She got the good good
She Michael Jackson bad
Im attracted to her
For her attractive ass
And now we murders
Because we kill time
I knock her lights out
And she still shine
I hate to see her go
But I love to watch her leave
But I keep her runnin back and forth
Like a soccer team
Cold as a winter day
Hot as a summers eve
Young money thieves
Steal your heart with ease

[Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walkin
If your walkin my way
Im that red bull
Now lets fly away
Lets buy a place
With all kinds of space
Ill let you be the judge
And Im the case
Im Gudda Gudda
I put her under
I see me with her
No Stevie wonder
She dont even wonder
Cuz she know she bad
And I got her n*gger
Grocery bag

[Young Lloyd)
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flinestone
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock

[Nicki Minaj]
Okay I get it
Let me think
I guess its my turn
Maybe its time to put this p*ssy on your sideburns
He say Im bad
He prolly right
He pressin me like buttons downs on a Friday night
Im so pretty like
We on my pedal bike
He on my low skirt
He on my edgar whites
He say Nicki dont stop
you the bestest
and I just be coming off the top as bestest

[Drake]
I Love ya tosha roll
Hotter than wasabi
I race for your love
Shake and bake
Ricky Bobby
Im at the W
But I cant meet you in the lobby
Girl I gotta watch my back
Cuz Im not just anybody
I seen them stand in line
Just to get beside her
I let her see the aston
And let the rest surprise her
Thats when we disappear
You need GPS to find her
Oh that was your girl?
I thought I recognized her

[Young Lloyd]
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flinestone
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock

[Tyga]
She like tanning
I like staying in
She like romancing
I like rollin with friends
She said Im caged in
I think her conscience is
she watching that oxygen
Im watching ESPN
But when that show ends
She all over my skin
Lotion
Slow emotions
Roller coastin
Like back and forth
Hold it
She pose like its for posters
And I poke like Im suppose to
Take this photo if you for me
she said dont you ever show this
Im to loyal and to focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this she rejoiced this
She said your words gets me open
So I closed it where your clothes
Im only lovin for the moment

[Jae Millz]
She aint got a man
But she not alone
Miss. Independent
Yeah she got her own
Hey gorgeous
Um, I mean flawless
Well, thats what your are
How I see it is how I call it
Look at how she walk
Mhm she know she bad
Do your thing baby
I aint even mad
And I aint even fast
Imma stay a while
Hold your head Chris
Imma take her down
(Young Lloyd)
Oh baby, I be stuck to you like glue baby
Wanna spend it all on you baby
My room is the g-spot
Call me Mr. Flintstone
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock
I can make your bed rock girl
I can make your bedrock
I can make your bedrock---Lyrics submitted by Samantha.
