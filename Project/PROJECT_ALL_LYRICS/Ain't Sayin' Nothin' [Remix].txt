The remix

Gotta say my name
Weezy f. baby

Aka it's the remix baby
Now let me get into it
N do it how I do it
Yeah, long hair don't care like the jewish
Ya'll Bitch made

And I eat beef but the cow eat nuthin
You probably say I didn't when I did
Or I wasn't when I was
And I'm not when I'm is
You n yo homies wack
U probably had too much of that corny yack
So watch where ya goin
And know where you at
Cause me and my goonz don't know you like that
Never been a sucka
Metal in the duffle
I'm all about my chips
I gets my ruffles
Joey I got ya
These boyz bluffing
I'm doin the hulk hogan but they ain't sayin nuthin

U ain't sayin nuthin
I be spendin euros by the pound I'm talkin london
If it ain't about some millions boy u ain't sayin nuthin, u ain't sayin nuthin
Actin like u tough, when it go down u go 2 runnin
Boy u ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't about money, money)
U ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
U ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
U ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
(Ayo macho, check it)
U ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)

I gotta pocket full of benjamins n I'm so cold
My neck froze like a penguin, somewhere in england
Waitin 4 my little duffle bag girl 2 land, with duffle bag in hand
It's louis vuitton and
She flyer than a eagle
Hood like a regal
She make my deposit, my closet is fresh segal
I rain terror, yes I rain terror,
Put my name on ya mind my style is new era
I been down in miami, sippin ballets with khaled
I gotta secret to tell dat boy ain't from cali
He from mars
Flow sicker than sars
Tore into his cars
My dunk sittin bigger than yours

Spit like a dominican I kall dat shhh big pun
And any n*gga that's a enemy to crack is a enemy to me, terror squad and the bu ain't sayin nuthin
I be spendin euros by the pound I'm talkin london
If it ain't about some millions boy u ain't sayin nuthin, u ain't sayin nuthin
Actin like u tough, when it go down u go 2 runnin
Boy u ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't about money, money)
U ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
U ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
U ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
U ain't sayin nuthin (If it ain't bout money, money)
