(DRAKE)

This here is on some truthful shit
It seems like everything I do, your used to it
And I hate hearing stories bout who you've been with

Swear I gotta hide, what I'm feelin inside
So you still think I'm confident and dumb

Is this gonna last? Your up on a pedestal
Are we moving too fast?
Feel like I'm in crazy competition with the past
This why I gotta ask, is 

anything I'm doin brand new?

Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Is anything I'm doin brand new?
Brand new, brand new, brand new, brand new
Brand new girl

(LIL WAYNE)

THIS HERE IS ON SOME REMIX SHIT

AND I HATE HEARIN STORIES OF WHO IM SLEEPIN WIT
[Brand New Remix Feat. Lil Wayne Lyrics On http://www.elyricsworld.com/ ]
