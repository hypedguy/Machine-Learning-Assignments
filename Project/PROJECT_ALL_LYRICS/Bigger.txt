The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
The love, the love is bigger
Big
[Verse 1]
Gotta believe in me 
Believe me like a fairytale
The tooth under your pillowcase 
And know I won't I won't
Ever, ever let you down (No)
Like a See-sa into town
You know why
Cuz we ain't on the playground no more

[Pre]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
A heart-breaker when I was little
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
And all the haters I swear
They look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger

[Verse 2]
Whoa oh
I remember when my heart was young
You were still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bullies in the school yard
Can't take my hugs and my kisses are from her
When ain't pushovers no more baby

[Pre]
We're big enough to stand in the picture
We're big enough to stand next to love

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
A heart-breaker when I was little
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
And all the haters I swear
They look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
A heart-breaker when I was little
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
And all the haters I swear
They look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger

[Verse 3]
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that
(Don't like Edle Lane?) Like Yesterday
(They shine on me) We were little then
(In class I dreamed about you) My baby
You wow wow (You wow wow)
Since then all I can remember is the love only got Bigger

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
A heart-breaker when I was little
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
And all the haters I swear
They look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger

[Chorus]
I was a player when I was little 
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
A heart-breaker when I was little
but now I'm bigger I'm bigger
And all the haters I swear
They look so small from up here
Cuz we're bigger, love's bigger, I'm bigger and you're bigger---
