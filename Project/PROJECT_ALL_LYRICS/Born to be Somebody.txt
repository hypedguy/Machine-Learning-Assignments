There's a dream in my soul
A fire that's deep inside me
There's a me know one knows
Waiting to be set free
I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it
I can taste it
Change is coming my way

I was born to be somebody
Aint' nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

This life can kick you around
This world can make you feel small
It'll not keep me down
I was born to stand tall
I'm going all the way
I can feel it
I believe it
I'm here, I'm here to stay

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me

Feel it...
Believe it...
Dream it...
Be it!!!!

I was born to be somebody
Ain't nothing that's ever gonna stop me
I'll light up the sky like lightning
I'm gonna rise above
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was born to be somebody
I was born to be
And this world will belong to me
Whoa oh
Whoa oh
And this world will belong to me
Ye-ah ye-ah
Oh
And this world will belong to me---Lyrics submitted by katie love.
