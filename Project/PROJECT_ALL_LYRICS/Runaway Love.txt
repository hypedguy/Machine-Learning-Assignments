Verse 1:
You see my  baby up and hit the road,
 where she's going that's what nobody knows...
I need to find her 'fore another man does
i wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just tryin to be cool cool cool..(tryin to be cool)
what you expect me to do..
im just tryin to find find this sweet love of mine..

Chorus:
I'm running out of time where is my runaway love?
Searchin' low and high know that i'm not givin up
give it all up for her..
cause it'll never be enough
i won't stop until i find my runaway love..

Verse 2:
See my baby really needs some help
'cause she can never stay at home by herself
she says she needs a little company
even if she's not always with me..

I'm just tryin to be cool cool cool
what you expect me to do(yeah)
im just tryin to find find find this sweet love of mine...
