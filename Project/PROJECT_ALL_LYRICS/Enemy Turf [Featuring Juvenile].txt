Ah hmmm hmmmm
Hmmmm Hmmm

Verse 1 (Juvenile)
When I say I don't give a fuck
I mean that yeah
Niggaz brains is gettin bust
I didn't say that yeah
If a shipment was comin in
I need a haul of dat wodie
I need a sixty-forty nigga
And no chargin' that wodie
You done heard about Michael Jackson
And shiggidy shit
But you ain't never heard about me
When i'm flissin a bitch
Niggas shoulders gettin knocked
Clean off of they head
See that red dot comin from
Me and my girlfriend
Cause I wants mine
I needs mine
And i'm about to get mine
At these times
Look lil' daddy
You ain't got to worry about none of these other niggas
You needs to be worried about when Juvi comin to get ya
Look, I make a phone call to the big dog
Y'all bitches better handle y'all business before I hit y'all
Even though a nigga rich and i rock ice
I still bust a nigga head on the block aright

(Chorus)2x (Juvenile---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
