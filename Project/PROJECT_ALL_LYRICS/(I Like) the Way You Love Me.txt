I was alone in the dark when I met ya
(wooooo)
You took my hand and you told me you loved me
(wooooo)
I was alone there wasn't love in my life
I was afraid of loving, you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight

I like the way how you holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you are loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you kissing me, you'll see
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)

It won't be long till we make vows, I bet ya
(Woooooooooo)
I thank the heavens above that I met ya
I was alone there wasn't love in my life
I was afraid of loving, you came in time
You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight 
(Wooooooooo)

I like the way how you loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are holdng me)
I like the way how you holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you kissing me
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)

It was a better place, 'cause you came in time
You took away the rain and brought the sunshine
I was afraid 'cause I was hurt the last time
ahhhhh


I like the way how you holding me
(It doesn't matter how you are holding me)
I like the way how you are loving me
(It doesn't matter how you are loving me)
I like the way how you touching me
(It doesn't matter how you are touching me)
I like the way how you kissing me, you'll see
(It doesn't matter how you are kissing me)
