Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh whoa

You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You want my love, you want my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends, what are you saying
Say there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

For you, I would have done whatever
And I just can't believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, 'cause I'm losin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
'Cause I'm in pieces, baby fix me
And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down
And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

And I'm like
Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby ooh

Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm sixteen and I thought that you'd be mine
I used to tweet you and text you and call you
And hit you on Facebook all the time
But but but but now you're gone
So far long that I can't even find you
You know that feeling when you leave your love
And it's right behind you
Can't believe that you did me wrong
We were on iChat all night long
Listening to our favorite song
She was wrong
I am gone
I thought I loved her
Never put no one above her
Yes she was my lover
But now on to another like

Baby, baby, baby ooh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

I'm gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
All I'm gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Now I'm all gone (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah)
Now I'm all gone (gone, gone, gone)
I'm gone---Lyrics submitted by May Zin.
