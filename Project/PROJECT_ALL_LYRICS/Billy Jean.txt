[1st verse] 
She was more like beauty queen from a movie scene 
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one 
Who will dance on the floor in the round 
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round 

[2nd verse] 
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene 
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one 
Who will dance on the floor in the round 

[Bridge] 
People always told me be careful what you do 
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts 
And mother always told me be careful who you love 
Be careful what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth 

[Chorus] 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 

[3rd verse] 
For forty days and forty nights 
The law was on her side 
But who can stand when she's in demand 
Her schemes and plans 
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round 
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice 
(Do think twice) 

[4th verse] 
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three 
Then she looked at me 
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin' 
His eyes were like mine 
Come on dance on the floor in the round, baby 

[Bridge] 
People always told me be careful what you do 
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts 
She came and stood right by me 
The smell of sweet perfume 
This happened much too soon 
She called me to her room 

[Chorus] 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, she says he is my son 
She says I am the one 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover---Lyrics submitted by alexis.
