[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Stop playin wit me cannon in my hand
And I'll be damn if any man disrespect me on my land
Intercept a niggas plans ineffective xxx nigga
I'm fi-fire man but I'll wet that xxx nigga
My vessel pump liquor
I'm a special xxx nigga
No frontin I'm in front of these extra last niggas
I'm a extra bad nigga I'm a side ways shooter
Open up the maserati xxxx the high way troopas
Cuz nowa days dudes a run and tell a troopa
So I hope that same trooper come find u when I lose ya (hey)
These niggas talkin out tha side of they medulla
Preserve a nigga put his body in a cooler
Turn hI'm into ice call me weezy the jeweler
Run up on me boy and get smoked like buddha
Who the xxxx wanna get it in ya next break
Gasoline on yo door steps... fire

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Sicka than a bird flu I am the bird man jr
And you niggas just bird food
We livin in a whirlpool u gotta eat or get ate
And you look like bait
Don't u stick one hand over the gate
This dog treat u niggas just like steak... dinner
I'm that nigga take a break
My xxxx up is a perfect mistake... I'm great
Murder renegade music my flow stupid
I'm cold I spit mucous
I'm tight like suchus, righteous, rootless strap shoot cha
We rich sue us
Snitch leave em
Bitch sue us
Pushin up daisies, roses, petunias
Weights?, funeral, service, communion
I'm hotta than the mother xxxxxx hot boys reunion... weezy---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
