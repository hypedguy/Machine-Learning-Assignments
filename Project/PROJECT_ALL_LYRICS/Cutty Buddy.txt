Cuz at the end of the night, you'll be my dinner tonight 
You see he dark, you always dim in his lights 
And that girl wana shine I bring her into the light

And since he feed her lies, i'll be her dessert on the side

How you do your lips like that, move your hips like that 
work your ass like that? 
Why you make noise like that move slow like that 
fuck fast like that? 
Baby I ain't gon lie to you we so sexually compatible 
How I thrill myself, I could kill myself when I feel myself 
You could be my cutty buddy, nibble on my nutty buddy 
While we do some freaky things whit the lights on 
Touching on you while i'm listening to T-pain 
Hugging on you while i'm listening to Mike Jones 
Then as soon as we got in the sac i can hit it in the back of the lack of a fifth of the yac like.......  

Its the middle of the night yall got into a fight 
Now your mad with your feelings hurt 
Girl let me buy you a drink please tell me what you think 
Right before i get up in them shirt (skeet skeet) 
Pull up in the lack truck (beep beep) 
Be shorty back up (feed me) 
If your man act up he full time, girl i'll be ya back up 
Cuz im your cutty buddy c-c-c-cutty buddy  
Soon as he fall asleep she on her way to love me 
cuz im your cutty buddy c-c-c-cutty buddy 
Soon as he fall asleep she on her way to love me 
She know that i (got that wood) 
And she know that my (sex is good) 
We can do it on the bed or the floor 
Cuz you know that i keep it hood 
She know that i (got that wood) 
And she know that my (sex is good) 
We can do it on the bed or the floor, let me know 

Oh, oh 
You can be my cutty cutty buddy, 
Fo' sho' you can ride with me 
Girl don't act like you don't already know, 
Act like you don't see 
We can get it on the bed or the floor, 
Don't matter to me girl 
I wana take you to h town  (frdy)....---Lyrics submitted by alfredo.
