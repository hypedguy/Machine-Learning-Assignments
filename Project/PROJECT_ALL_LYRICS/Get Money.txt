Not to fast not to slow 
At a nice pace now 
I was something like a king 
More like an ace now 
Had splurge in they payment money 
Them dudes straight clowns 
Used to use shoeboxes 
Paper in a safe now 
Couldn't afford a tall can 
Now bottles by the crates now 
Do yo Do yo

Creeps call me crylon 
Cuz Green I can spray now
