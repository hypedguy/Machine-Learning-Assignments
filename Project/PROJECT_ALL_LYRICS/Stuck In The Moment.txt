With you,
With you,
I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place

Now Romeo & Juliet,
Bet They could never felt the way we felt,
Bonnie & Clyde,
Never had the highlight,
We do,
We do

You and i both know it cant work,
Its all fun and games,
til someone gets hurt,
And i dont,
I wont let that be you


Now you dont wont to let go 
And i dont wanna let you know, 
There might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we dont wont to fall but, were tripping in our hearts and its reckless and 
clumsy, cuz i know you cant love me
Here



See like Adam & Eve,
Tragedy was a destiny,
like sunny and Cher  
I dont care, i got u baby 
See were both fighting each inch of our fiber 
Cuz ant no way its gonna end right, but we both to foolish to stop


Now you dont wanna let go,
And i dont wanna let you know,
There might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we dont wont to fall but, Were tripping in our hearts and its reckless and clumsy, cuz i know you cant love me  
here


I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And theres nothing my heart can do (Can Do),
To fight with time and space cause,
Im still stuck in the moment with you

See like just because this cold, cold world is sayin we cant be 
Baby we both have the right to disagree 
it and i aint with it 

And i dont wanna be so old and gray 
reminiscing 'bout the better days 
But conventions tellin us to let go, 
so we'll never know,

I wish we had another time, i wish we had another place 
Cuz everything we did everything we have is stuck in the moment 
(Yeaaah ooh woahhh)
I wish we had another time 
i wish we had another 
place 
ooh noo 

But everything we have is stuck in the moment 
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do)
But to fight with time and space 
'cause im still stuck i the moment with you---Lyrics submitted by Mookie.
