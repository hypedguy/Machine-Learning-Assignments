Lately I've been thinkin' , 
Thinkin' 'bout what we had 
I know it was hard,
It was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinkin' ,
To take the pain away ?
I wish that I could give you
What you , deserve 
'Cause nothing could ever,
Ever replace you
Nothing can make me 
Feel like you do 
You know theres no one,
I can relate to 
And know we won't find a love thats so true.

There's nothing like us ,
There's nothing like you and me 
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us ,
There's nothing like you and me , 
Together

I gave you everything baby , 
Everything I had to give 
Girl, why would you push me away ?
Lost in confusion,
Like an illusion 
You know I'm used to making your day.
But that is the past now,
We didn't last now
Guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it ?
We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

There's nothing like us ,
There's nothing like you and me 
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us ,
There's nothing like you and me , 
Together

There's nothing like us ,
There's nothing like you and me 
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us ,
There's nothing like you and me , 
Together---Lyrics submitted by TurkDirectioner.
