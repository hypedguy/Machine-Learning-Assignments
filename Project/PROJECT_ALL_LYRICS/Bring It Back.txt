Ladies and gentlemen,
People with jobs,
People without jobs,
Middle class,
Upper class,
High class, all dat,
Cats, snakes, chickens, ducks,
Elderly people and twerkers

Put ya hands on ya knees and bend ya rump,
Put ya back in,
Back out
Do da hump.
Put ya hands on ya knees
And bend ya rump,
Put ya back in,
Back out do da hump,

Well, I'm fly as son of a gun a son
Of a Stunna, (yep)

Weezy F da reverend preach about me I'm da god 1-7 apple and E

And I sleep with da sharks,
Shorty on da water water,
And I be ma 840 mama,
Shake sumfin fo' me,
And it don't make sense if it don't make dat money,
Ima take dat money,...
