This is why I do this shit.

I think they call this, uhm, venting.

Verse 1:

Look
Uhh.

This is me.
Still the same.
They want the hits.
I play the game.
No auto tune, but you can feel the pain.
It all comes spilling out like i hit a vein.
Watt up lil Braw.
Watt up slum Ville.
I hope you know that yall the reason i have fun still.
The fans thinking that we all signed for one meal.
Equal opportunities rapping, that shit is unreal.
That aint how it works.
That aint that how it goes.
And I been getting high to balance out the lows.
And I could use a writer to balance out my flows.
But I never share my thoughts,
This is all a nigga knows.
And every time I try, it opens up my eyes.
These verses are a chance to be remembered and reprised.
And I would be performing just as long as Im alive.
So every word I utter will be mine.

Chorus:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
Oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

Verse 2:
I never cried when Pac died.
But I probably will when Hov does.
And if my tears hold value, then i would drop one for every single thing he showed us.
And Ill be standing in a puddle.
I stay away from niggas that could land me in some trouble.
And ima keep it honest.
Am so tired of being subtle.
Its just me, Forty, O, and nich standing in a huddle.
Staring at the members of my team.
Who get questioned about they profit from this million dollar scheme.
Just know that am in debt for you defending all our dreams.
I hope you tell your family this shit aint what it seems.
But yall the reason for a lot of my devotion.
You know I spend money because spending time is hopeless.
And know I pop bottles cuz i bottle my emotions.
At least I put it all in the open.

Chorus:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.

Verse 3:
Look.
Fuck all yall.
We ignore feelin's here.
Premature millionaires.
Welcome to my realest year.
Yeah.
I swear we making a killah here.
I should be on top of the world here just chillen here.
Uh.
But its funny having fans.
Who find you before anybody ever has the chance, and build you up so you could be the biggest in the game.
And realize when your there, sometimes the shit dont feel the same.
Yeah.
And plus things are just so real at home
People think Ive changed just because my appeal has grown
And now security follow me everywhere so im never actually am alone, i just always feel alone.
I think im scared of what the future holds.
I was wishing for some things and now am used to those.
Every girl I meet thinks im fucking groupie hoes.
The honesty of my music has left me too exposed.
All my old friends think i got a new crowd.
And people seem to notice every time I do smile.
I guess that mean they come few and far between.
Even though am living out what you would call adream.
Yeah.
And my uncle aint even messaging me.
And him missing in my life is kind of messing with me.
I hope this isnt one of those forever things.
Its funny how money can change everything.

Chorus:
Dont believe the lies.
Look me in my eyes.
Please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
I remember you.
This feeling isnt new.
So please dont be scared of me.
Please dont be scared of me.
oh oh oh oh oh uhh.---Lyrics submitted by Corrin.
