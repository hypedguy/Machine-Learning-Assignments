I always knew you were the best
the coolest girl i know
so prettier than all the rest
the star of my show

so many times i wished
you'd be the one for me 
but never knew i'd get like this
girl,what you do to me

you're who i'm thinking of
girl, you ain't my runner up
and no matter what
you're also number one

my prize possesion, one and only
adore you girl, i want you
the one i can't live without
thats you, thats you

You're my special little lady
the one that makes me crazy
of all the girls i've ever known
its you, its you

my favorite, my favorite
my favorite, my favorite girl
my favorite girl

you're used to going out your way
to impress those Mr. Wrongs
but you can be yourself with me
and show 'em how we feel

i know they siad believe in love 
its a dream that can't be real
so girl lets write a fairytale
and show 'em how we feel

you're who i'm thinking of
girl, you ain't my runner up
and no matter what they say 
your also number one

my prize possesion, one and only
adore you girl, i want you
the one i can't live without
Thats you, Thatyou

you're my special little lady
the one thats makes me crazy 
of all the girls i've ever known 
its you, its you

my favorite, my favorite
my favorite, my favorite girl
baby its you

my favorite,my favorite
my favorite, my favorite girl
my favorite girl

you take my breath away
with everything you say
i just wanna be with you
my baby,my baby, oh

my miss don't play no games
treat you no other way
than you deserve
'cause you're the girl of my dreams

my prize possesion, one and only
adore you girl,i want you
the one i can't live without
its you,its you---Lyrics submitted by samantha kirk.
