I think about the block keep it close like treasure
Keep it packed away where no one come in to
Got pulled out of the mix like forever and ever
I thought you told me how you felt about it in your letter
But that is all behind me like georgio armani
I'm sipping campari feed my dog salami
Never gave nobody up, I did my time I didn't bitch
Since I been back I heard you switched

Chorus:
But I'm back on the block and the air tastes sweeter
Yeah I'm back on the block and I barely believe ya
Yeah I'm back on the block and the air tastes sweeter
Yeah I'm back on the block

I remember the block and how it all began
You was a ramblin' man with a shake in your hand
Now, when they ran up fisty cuts in the plan
One who does it, who you was
So you dropped it on the cousin and you blamed it on me
He said nothing to the man but he said something to me
One, two, three but still I gave him the fifth
But since I've been back I heard you switched

And she keeps goin' on and on about it, hmm hmm
And he keeps goin' on and on and on about it
And drunk eddie from the store, he keeps goin' on and on about it
He keeps goin' on and on about it.

Chorus (4x)---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
