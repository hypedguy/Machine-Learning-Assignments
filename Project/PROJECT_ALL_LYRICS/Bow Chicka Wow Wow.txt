Once I throw on this
Once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this
Once I throw on this
It's over girl

I hear you knock, knock, knock
Baby, come on up
I hope you got, got, got
Something in your cup
Cause I'm three shots deep
And I ain't trying to sleep
Get your red bull on cause I'm ready
You've been playing naughty
To get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want, right?
Tell me what you want though
Tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow
What you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave
But I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right
I'm a make you sound like
I'm a make you sound like

Are you trying to make me
Wait, wait, wait 'till the second day?
But I can't, can't, can't even contemplate
Waiting one more minute, let me jump in it
I brought you flowers and a teddy
You've been playing naughty
To get with me all night
We both know exactly what you want, right?
Tell me what you want though
Tell me what you gon' do
What you gon' do

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow
What you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave
But I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right
I'm a make you sound like
Yeah, I can make you sound like

Now I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive
Girl you know you like that
Say, I ain't even gotta say shit
To make you feel alive
Girl you know you like that

Once I throw on this bow chicka wow wow
What you gonna say?
You act like you gon' leave
But I know that you gon' stay
Break it down, dicky down down
Girl, don't even play
Once I set the mood right
I'm a make you sound like
Yeah, I'm a, yeah I'm a make ya

Once I throw on this
Once I throw on this
It's over girl
Once I throw on this
Once I throw on this
It's over girl ---Lyrics submitted by Jermira Brooks.
