What you waiting for?
I know you're watching me
Hey boy, come on and take me now

What you waiting for?
I know you're watching me
Hey boy, come on and take me now

Can I talk to you for a minute?
You've been looking all night for your shining star
Well baby, here I am, so why you waiting?
Step on over, let me show you how bad you are

Just let me take the lead
All you gotta do is let your mind be free
Let's hit the floor and cause a scene
Get real wet if you know what I mean, what you say baby?

Take me now
I'm hungry for your loving
(And she said)
Show me how
You got me working, honey

Right now
I'm hot just like an oven
(And she said)
So take me now
Boy, you make me feel like I gotta dance

I gotta dance, gotta dance baby, I gotta dance

I feel good to you, you try to hide it
But I can tell by the way you push up close to me
Your body temperature is arising
Something's going down as far as I can see

Just let me take the lead
All you gotta do is let your mind be free
Let's hit the floor and cause a scene
Get real wet if you know what I mean, what you say baby?

Take me now
I'm hungry for your loving
(And she said)
Show me how
You got me working, honey

Right now
I'm hot just like an oven
(And she said)
So take me now
Boy, you make me feel like I gotta dance

You know
Don't I
Say, don't I make you feel like you gotta dance

Once I get to know ya
(No)
I'm gonna show ya
(No)
That there's no better way
(Yea)
Let's dance the night away
(Yea)

I wanna control ya
(No)
Just wanna hold ya
(No)
Dance the night away
So what you say baby, what you say?
(What you saying to me?)

Take me now
(Oh)
I'm hungry for your loving
(Hungry for you)
(And she said)
Show me how
(Oh)

(Hot just like an oven)
(And she said)

Like you gotta dance, like you gotta dance, like you gotta dance, no
