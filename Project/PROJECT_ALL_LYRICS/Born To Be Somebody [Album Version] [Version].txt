There's a Dream in my Soul
A Fire that's deep inside me
There's a me no one knows
Waiting to be set Free

I'm gonna see that day
I can feel it
I can taste it
Change is coming my way

I was Born to Be Somebody
Ain't nothing thats ever gonna stop me
I light up the sky like Lighting 
I'm gonna rise above 
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was Born to Be Somebody
I was born to be
and this world will belong to me

This life can kick you around
This world can make you feel small
it will not get me down
I was born to stand tall

I'm going all the way
I can feel it 
I believe it
I'm here I'm here to stay

I was born to be Somebody
Ain't nothing thats ever gonna stop me
I light up the sky like lighting 
I'm gonna rise above 
Show 'em what I'm made of 
I was born to be Somebody
I was Born to be
and this world will belong to me

Feel it
Believe it
Dream it
Be it

I was born to be Somebody
Ain't nothing thats ever gonna stop me 
I light up the sky like lighting
I'm gonna rise above 
Show 'em what I'm made of
I was Born to be Somebody
I was born to be
and this world will belong to me

Whoa oh oh Whoa oh oh
and this world will belong to me
Yeah Yeah oh oh oh
And this world will belong to Me---Lyrics submitted by Hannah.
