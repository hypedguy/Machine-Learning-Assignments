[Drake]
Im a hard gotta get along wit
get on a song wit
where shit be going right
well I just flip it to the wrong shit
the team that I belong to
tha artists I put on wit
dont ever ask for nothin cause them niggaz got they own shit
feel Weezy like a mouthful of hot peppers
black Ferrari with the red seats
I call it playin checkers
Im never doing verses
Im forever giving lectures
if youre tryna meet with money
Id be happy to connect ya
life is, better than its ever been
scheduling million dollar meetings with the president
someone cut the lights, oh
where is Thomas Edison



got a new condo watch me as I settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
and if you tryna zone I got a whole swisher sweet full
rappers are liars and they women are deceitful
adding till they subtract me I never be a equal
last place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
then he got it for me and Im happy as can be now
bout to start ballin like Im coming off a rebound
yea
and I shall have the most bragging rights
because a nigga spit crack, bag it tight
hate when rappers say they tryna get they swagger right
cause I done came Im mo fire than a dragon fight
fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
you aint heard of me then you should go and get a Blues Clue
oops I mean a red clue
Waynes here, su WOO
bet he felt that like the end of a pool cue
but I aint banging I aint waving no flag
Im ATF but they aint seein no badge
its heartbreak Drake I hate to see em so sad
I could son you, see a little me in yo dad
Im the same little boy that used to play up on Degrassi
he can pocket twenty thousand to be anywhere they ask, me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
burning like a Camel Light
stupid hoe ash me
but dont ask me shit about me
and no the game really aint shit without me
she might have to pay me but I dick her down free
wanna know if its the truth then pull the zipper down and see
no homo though

[Lil Wayne]

This is my promise
Ima bring that barrel to them bitches
Eye liners and what I make up will fuck up your skin
I pick the buck up and buck buck and buck buck again
I will butt fuck your friend then suck up her twin
I put the buck up to him then buck buck and buck buck and buck buck again

like Lubriderm on a new tattoo I had to
kick my princess up out my castle dad who
never had that dude

I do everything good as you know I do everything better
I get paid for every letter ABC etcetera

and my exit comin up yup

if money is the it you want me with
and ill probably just spit on the chick you wont be with
and I hate a bony bitch only like em only thick
and I own hiphop if you dont spit Im gon evict
and I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
and I think his name was kinda like drake drizzy rogers or
drizzy drake rogers im too busy to play father
and when it comes to the game Im to willing to play harder
so harder I go there he go
they chant mvp when I shoot a free-throw, CEO
jazz what it do
the haters on that face and then their ass is a shoe
faster than you
badder than you
radder than you, etcetera
I told u I get paid by the letter like
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
z top, yes he rock
and me and drizzy both wrote on detox
that was just a foot note
how long can he could go
wonderin when he stop?
bitch when the beat stop
so ima keep rockin
till the sheetrock bend
and that heat I send
burn skin
the end
young mula baby, un huh---Lyrics submitted by ronnie.
