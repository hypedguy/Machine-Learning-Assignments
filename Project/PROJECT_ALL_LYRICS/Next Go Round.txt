I wanna do it till the sun comes up,
until we're both so good 'n sweaty that we can't stand up.
I wanna do it till we're both about to drop,
as long as we're caught in tied up together then we're never gonna stop.

I wanna go until the neighbours all complain,
cause they heard somebody screamin and they think we're both in pain.
I wanna go so long your parents think you've died,
they're gonna call the cops, the CIA, and then the FBI.

(chorus)
Yeah, we're gonna love it when the lights go down.
Hold on here we go.
Yeah, we're gonna go until our legs give out.
Round and round we go.
Yeah, we're gonna do it hangin' upside down.
Up and down we go.
Yeah, we're gettin' ready for the next go round.
Round and round we go.

So, shut the windows, lock the door, unplug the phone,
for all intents and purposes there ain't no body home.
Then we can do it till the batteries are gone,
and borrow two from the TV remote to turn this thing back on.

I wanna cover you with jello in the tub,
we can roll around for hours without ever comin' up.
I want you naked with your favourite heels on,
slap john deere across my ass and ride me up and down the lawn.
