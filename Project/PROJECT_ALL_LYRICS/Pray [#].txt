oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
oh oh oh oh
and i pray

i just can't sleep tonight
knowing that things 'aint right
it's in the papers
it's on the TV
it's everywhere that i go
children are crying
soldiers are dying
some people don't have a home
but i know there's sunshine beyond that rain
i know there's good times beyond that pain
hey!
can you tell me how i can make a change

[Chorus]
i close my eyes and i can see a better day
i close my eyes and
pray...
i close my eyes
and i can see a better day
i close my eyes and
pray...

i lose my appetite (carry it carry it)
knowing kids starve tonight
Am i a sinner?
cause half my dinner is still there  on my plate
oohhh..
i got a vision
to make a difference
and it's starting today
cause i know there's sunshine beyond that rain
i know this good times beyond that pain
heaven tell me i can make a change

[Chorus]
i close my eyes and i can see a better day
i close my eyes and
pray (yeey)
i close my eyes
and i can see a better day
i close my eyes and .....

I pray!!
for the broken hearted
i pray for the life not started
i pray for all the most not breathing
i pray for all the souls that need a break
can you give 'em one today

i just can't sleep tonight
can someone tell me how to make a change

Chorus]
i close my eyes and i can see a better day
i close my eyes and
pray (oh ooh)
i close my eyes
and i can see a better day
i close my eyes and...

i prayyyyyy!!!! (ooh ooh)
i prayyyyyy!!! (yeah)
i prayyyyyy~

i close my eyes and
pray
yeahhh~...---
