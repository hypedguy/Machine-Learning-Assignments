When I met you girl my heart went knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach wont stop stop and even though its a struggle love is all we got
And we gonna keep keep climbin till the mountain top
your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
my breath is your breath
And your heart (and now ive got my)
Chorus:
One love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you) 
Ill be your one, guy
You'll be my #1 girl always makin time for you
Im'a tell you one time 

You look so deep
You know that it humbles me,
Your by my side and troubles them dont trouble me
Many have called but the chosen Is you
Whatever you want shawty ill give it to you

your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
your breath is my breath
And your heart (and now ive got my)

Chorus:
One love
My one heart
My one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you) 
Ill be your one, guy
You'll be my #1 girl always makin time for you
Im'a tell you one time 
Shawty right there
Shes got everything I need and im gon tell her one time
Give you everything you need down to my last dime
She makes me happy
I know where ill be
Right by your side cause she is the one

Chorus:
And girl youre my
My one love
My one heart my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time (girl I love, girl I love you) 
Ill be your one, guy
Youll be my #1 girl always makin time for you
Im'a tell you one time---Lyrics submitted by dakota.
