There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

How many I told ya's
Lets start overs
and shoulders
Have you cried on before

How many promises
Be honest, girl
How many tears you let
hit the floor

How many bags you packed
Just to take 'em back
Tell me that
How many either or's
But no more
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Oh no
Saw so many pretty faces
Before I saw you, you
Now all I see is you

Oh no
Don't need these other pretty faces
Cause when you're mine
In the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I'm gonna put you first
I'll show you what you're worth
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Christmas was a merry fourteenth
of February
Not one of them spent with you

How many dinner dates 
Set dinner plates
And he didn't even touch his food

How many torn photographs 
Are you tapin' back
Tell me that
Did you see an open door (idk if thats right)
But no more
If you let me inside of your world

Oh no
Saw so many pretty faces
Before I see you, you
Now all I see is you

Oh no
Don't need these other pretty faces
Cause when you're mine
In the world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart
I can give you a brand new start
I can make you believe
I just wanna set one girl free
to fall
Cause she's free to fall
With me and my heart'd like to know 
When i got the key to take you and lead the world with one less lonely
Yeah

There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl
One less lonely girl
Yeah---Lyrics submitted by Desiree.
