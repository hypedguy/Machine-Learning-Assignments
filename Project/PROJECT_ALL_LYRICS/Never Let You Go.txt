yeahhh. . .

Oohh noo, oh noo, ooohh
They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby give me one last hug

There's a moment i've been chasin 
and i finally caught it out on this floor 

 baby theres no hesitation no
reservation by taking a chance and moreee

ohh no, becuz 

It's like an angel came by, 
and took me to heaven
Cuz when I stare in your eyes
It couldnt be better

let the music it blast
We gon' do our dance
bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Cuz this lifes to long
And this love's to strong
So baby know for sho'
That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feelin' no pain no fear
Oh no, don't have a care in the world
Why would I, when you are here
There's a moment I've been chasin
And I finally caught it out on this floor

Baby, there's no hesitation,
No reservation by taking a 
chance and moreeee
ohh no, becuz

It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven
Cuz when I stare in your eyes
It couldnt be better

let the music it blast
We gon' do our dance
bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Cuz this lifes to long
And this love's to strong
So baby know for sho'
That I'll never let you go

It's like an angel came by, 
and took me to heaven
Cuz when I stare in your eyes
It couldnt be better

so Take my hand, lets just dance
Watch my feet, follow me
Don't be scared, girl I'm here
If you didn't know, this is loooovee

oohhh

So let the music it blast
We gon' do our dance
bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Cuz this lifes to long
And it's much to strong
So baby no for sho'

I'll never let you go, ooooohh....
I'll never let you go,

(Oohh noo, oh noo, ooohh)

I'll never let you go,
Ohh , ohh , ohh

ill never let you go---Lyrics submitted by anna.
