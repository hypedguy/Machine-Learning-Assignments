I know that things are getting tougher
When you can't get the top off from the bottom of the
barrel.
Wide open road of my future now...
It's looking fucking narrow.

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothin'
All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothin'

We get told to decide.
Just like as if I'm not going to change my mind.

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothin'
All I know is that I don't don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothin'

[Solo]

Whatcha gonna do with yourself,
Boy better make up your own mind...
Whatcha gonna do with yourself boy,
You're running out of time.

All I know is that I don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothin'
All I know is that I don't don't know
All I know is that I don't know nothin'

And that's fine...---Lyrics submitted by Nellie.
