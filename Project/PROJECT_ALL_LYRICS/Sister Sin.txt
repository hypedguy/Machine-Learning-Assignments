Yeah, the lady and me both agree
Some days we just don't get along
But the whiskey in me both agree
Maybe we both just better off
Well, the preacher believe
I don't need all of these demons hanging on
But we both know if they don't
I'll get lonely, need a few to tag along

Hanging here by a thread
Hearing voices inside my head
I'll be besides you overnight
Forever a day, And I'll be gone
She said in case you haven't notice that
I ain't about to anymore

The wagon I'm in is paper thin
I think one wheel's coming off
This is the thin with that green
Where you've been
So kind of you to help me out

Hanging here by a thread
Hearing voices inside my head
I'll be besides you every night
Everyday, and I'll be gone
She said in case you haven't notice that
I ain't about to anymore

Operate, scheming come
Lying face down in the mud
Please don't hate, broke no church
Rock them out just what I've done

Operate, scheming come
Lying face down in the mud
Please don't hate, broke no church
Rock them out just what I've done

Lying face down in the mud
Rock them out just what I've done
Rock them out just what I've done

I'll be besides you every night
Everyday, and I'll be gone
She said in case you haven't notice that
I ain't about to anymore

I'll be besides you every night
Everyday, and I'll be gone
She said in case you haven't notice that
I ain't about to anymore---
