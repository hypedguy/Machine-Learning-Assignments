[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Hoe no oh Joe he did it he's back in the back o' that black mayback tripin
Now blow that mother fuckin kush up in da sky
La la lala la la la
Bompin that Kanye you can't tell me nothing right
La la lala la la la la
Hand on a shot gun
And I'm riding shot gun
Uzis, banana clips, what what I got some
Bullets a whole sale food stamps coupon
Yellow mustard phantom call e-Cray poop on
I can make it back man Joe is here too long
We up a hundred grand when ever I hear a new song
Come on come on that's too many ringtones
2.8 what u want me to tell ya
Make it rain man Rhiana goin grab an umbrella
Ella ella ella
Holly shit so much coke a nigga had to shovel it
So much coke a nigga change his government
Now we can all sing along for the fuck of it
Crack crack crack crack

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Hey this is the crack house
Welcome to the crack house
I mean am talkin more pies than a phrat house
This is the problem this is not music
I hope u find it cause he about to loose it
Joey don't do it joey done did it
Joey keep doin it until your done with it
Bring em to the crack house
Show em the crack house
Take em to the crack house
We in the crack house

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
U gotta touch your toes oh I'm out
Fuck a club I got a strip pole in ma house
Six million ways to make it rain hold up
Conflicts in ma chain from Mangolia
Convicts in ma plane where we rolla
N' they hustle yay not vitaminwater
Fat cause I'm so rich rich cause I'm so hood
Uzi your whole whip, nigga I'm that hood
U flow cold but joe flow sicka
Every rapper now be like joes that nigger
John Gotti supreme team show
These are the niggaz u compare to joe hello

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Hello this is the crack house
Welcome to the crack house
I mean am talkin more pies than a phrat house
This is the problem this is not music
I hope u find it cause he about to loose it
Joey don't do it joey done did it
Joey keep doin it untill u done with it
Bring em to the crack house

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
Hey weez just stop right there

And their time tickin like an auto mare
First nigga pop up n we gave them the piece
Next nigga probably leave 'em under the sheets
Come on popey u talkin to me
Ain't no body else runnin these streets cock suckaaaa

[Chorus: Lil' Wayne]
Heeeey this is the crack house
Welcome to the crack house
I mean am talkin more plies than a phrat house

They don't want the crack house
Kick em out da crack house---Lyrics submitted by chelsi.
