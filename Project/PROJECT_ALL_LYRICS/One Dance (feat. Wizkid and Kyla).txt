Baby I like your style

Grips on your legs
Front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe
But I never run away
Even when I'm away
OT, OT, there's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking ahold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking ahold on me

Baby I like your style

Strength and guidance
All that I'm wishing for my friends
Nobody makes it from my ends
I had to bust up the silence
You know you gotta stick by me
Soon as you see the text, reply me
I don't wanna spend time fighting
We've got no time

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking ahold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking ahold on me

I need to know where do you wanna go
Cause if you're down, I'll take it slow
Make you lose control
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Where, where, where
Where, where, where, where
Cause if you're down, cause if you're down
Cause if you're down

That's why I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking ahold on me
I need a one dance
Got a Hennessy in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Higher powers taking ahold on me---
