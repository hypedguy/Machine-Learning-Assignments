Oh, looking like another Bob Marley day
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon

We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
Cheech and Chong probably woulda smoked them all
So, I'm out, on the couch this afternoon

Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
If we take'em all back, we can buy some more
So, I doubt, we'll go without this afternoon

(chorus)
Oh, you better hang on if your taggin' along
Cause we'll be doin' this till six in the mornin'
Nothing wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when your drivin'
Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, then we do it all again
Just sittin' around, hangin' out this afternoon

Landlord says I should buy a tent
But he can kiss my ass cause I payed the rent
So, I doubt, he'll kick me out this afternoon

Down on the corner in a seedy bar
Juke box cranking out the CCR
Have a few to Suzy Q this afternoon

(chorus)
Oh, you better hang on if your taggin' along
Cause we'll be doin' this till six in the mornin'
Nothing wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when your drivin'
Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, then we do it all again
Yeah we get up, we go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, then we do it all again
Yeah, just sitting around hanging out this afternoon

Don't want a wrist watch, or an alarm clock to see what time it is
From the moment I wake up I just love bein' with my friends
We barely get by, but have the best times
And hope it never ends
We drink all day until we fall down
So we can do it all again

It's not the human walk, it's the human race
You feel your livin' on the edge takin' too much space
So, I doubt, I'll figure out just what to do
'Bout to kick it around hangin' out this afternoon

(chorus)
Oh, you better hang on if your taggin' along
Cause we'll be doin' this till six in the mornin'
Nothing wrong with goin' all night long
Tough to put the brakes on
Doesn't matter when your drivin'
Get up and go out, me and all my friends
Drink up, fall down, then we do it all again
Yeah, we get up, we go out, me and all my friends
We drink up, fall down and we do it all again
Just kickin' around hanging out this afternoon

Sittin' around hangin' out this afternoon

(Last call you sons a bitches)

Just kickin' around hangin' out this afternoon

(Yeaaahh)

Just sittin' around hangin' out this afternoon 

(Drinks on the house)

Just sittin' around hangin' out this afternoon (repeat out)---Lyrics submitted by magnus.
