Yeah!
Stat quo
Doc Dre
I representin the A town
A town
Aye aye aye
I'm comin' from the A town
A town
Shady Aftermath

Yeah
Once again it's on
Em, stat now alive
And this motherfucker on
The ho's get naked
Soon as the song comes on
The niggas get reckless
It's off the chain
It's on
It's papa speakers
Knockin' crowds off the floor
They jockin' and watchin
When I walks through the door
It's him
Tell a friend
But you already know
Act stupid and lose it
Don't fuck with quo
I'm kind of different
Not the usual
Sippin' cognac between two beautiful
Two bitches at the club
Talk shit at your funeral
I came to get a buzz and crunk
Understand yo
It's crowded in back
He's jumpin
God damn it's slow
I'm cooler than cool
Cause my temperature is thirty below
I'm checkin' the scene for new cunt
Droppin' it low
Shakin' they ass
Backin' it up
Fast or slow

You know this thing don't stop till I say so
Now get low
Get low
Keep that ass on the floor
You know this club don't close till I say so
Now get low
Get low
Keep that ass on the flow
Now get low
Get low
Keep that ass on the floor
Now get low
Get low
Keep that ass on the floor

It goes three two one shortie
That's what's up
At the bar lookin sober
But I'm high as fuck
And as far as yall who be actin' tough
I'm in the spot with the glock
Please believe it's tough
We ready we sweaty
It's hot
It's off the chain
We macin' and spewin
Please miss tell me what's ya name
The way you move and them jeans
Made me happy you came
I'm tryin' to get to know ya
Possibly get some brain
I need pinky rings
I'm the man of your dreams
Your life if you wanna be wifey
And join my team
So I can support you
And support you by any means
Nah
I ain't givin' you none of my things
But we can leave the club tonight
Hit the telly
And fuck
Long as you know when I bust
I'm in the dust
Ain't no children
It ain't nothing nothing for us to discuss
Except what time your ride pickin' you up

You know this thing don't stop till I say so
Now get low
Get low
Keep that ass on the floor
You know this club don't close till I say so
Now get low
Get low
Keep that ass on the flow
Now get low
Get low
Keep that ass on the floor
Now get low
Get low
Keep that ass on the floor

Turn that ass around
Go on and do somethin do somethin girl
Girl touch the ground
Now drop drip drop drip low yeah
Now drop drip drop drip low yeah
Now drop drip drop drip low yeah
