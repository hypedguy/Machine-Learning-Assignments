Chorus:
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that

1st verse: 
Focus on women then you get less done
Its like work flow its heavy like a wet sponge
Im gettin rich caue i think being broke is less fun 
Celebratin fathers day everyday so dont get son
Where you tryna go im ready
Pick any place in the world the doe is comin in steady
im chillen out with T and J and nico
my city aint a city that support they own people 
but i run it you say something about it, i doubt it
I got this gucci wallet i do not leave home without it
Im bout it , im bout it
im standing in on these concerts saying bring these booth with bottle no we do not need to stop it biii-ttt-ch
part of me that was rude
if you just started balling i say im bout to conclude
what more is there to do
and why i would pretend
she call me and i hit it everytime like send (damn)

Chorus
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that

2nd verse:

never embelish belive em cause he aint exist
the stars on my team but i lead the league in asist
never been a beliver that previoiusly exist
I wonder what i be doin when prevously is this
I do breakfast at the obby you can grab some lunch to go
Have a dinner at the toe 
right across from lindsy lohan 
dont i treat you better than your ol
man we couldnt have done it this show enough

im throwed and im high
i guess im throwed up
tone it all down
my nigga grow up
and tell me when you start getting paid to show up ..dammn

Chorus
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that
I got friends with money and i got money too
so we put it together
and let you pick what to do it and then we do that---
