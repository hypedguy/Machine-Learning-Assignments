(Verse 1)
Your walkin down a horror corridor
It's almost 4 in the mornin
And your in a
Nightmare
It's HORRIBLE
Right there's the coroner
Waitin for you
To turn the corner
So he can corner ya
Your a goner
He's ona ya
Out the corner of his cornea
He just saw you run
All you want is to rest
Cause you can't run anymore
Your done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody
Is watchin in the party applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplading my next plot again
Swallowin the Klonopin
While I'm noddin
In and out on the autumn and
If the ramada inn
Holdin onto the pill bottle then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom
And make sure I got all of it
Wake up naked at mcdonalds
With
Blood all over me
Dead bodies
Behind the counter
SHIT
Guess I must of just blacked out again
NOT AGAIN

(Chorus)
It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

I said
It's 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

(Verse 2)
Sitting nude in my living room
It's almost noon
I wonder what's on the tube
Maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel
Until I find hannah montana
Then I reach for the aloe and lanalin
Bust all over the wall panel and dismantlin
Every candle on top of the fire place
Mantalin
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
Kiss the naked manakin man again
You can see him standin in my
Front window
If you look in
I'm just a hooligan
Who's use to usin hallicinogens
Causin illusions again
Brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin
Raise the scissors and pins
Jesus when does it end
Phases that I go through
Dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
Gave these molecules too
Me
What am I gone do
Had the prodical son
The diabolical one
Very methodical
I slaughtered them

(Chorus)
It's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

I said
It's 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

(Verse 3)
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
She puts the lotion in the bucket
He puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again

I duck and I slash slice and gash
Last night was a blast
I can't quite remember when I
Had that much fun
Off a half pint of the jack
My last vic and a half
A flashlight
Up kim kardashians ass

I remember the first time
I dismembered a family member
December I think it was
I was having drinks with my cuz
And I wrapped him
In christmas lights
Pushed him into the stinkin tub
Cut him up into pieces
Then just when I went to drink his
Blood
I thought I outta drink this bath water
That outta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder man slaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
That might be an artery son
Your blood curdling screams
Just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 am
And here I come
So you should probably run
A secret passage way around here
Man there's got to be one
Oh no there's probably none
He can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs
It aint no stoppin me from choppin him up(up)

(Chorus)
Cause it's 3 a.m in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

I said
It's 3 am in the mornin
Put my key in the door and
Bodies layin all of the floor and
I don't remember how they got there but I guess I must of killed em
Killed em

Yooo (yoooo)
A yoooo (a yoooo)
Yooo (yoooo)
A yoooo (a yoooo)
Yooo (yoooo)
A yoooo (a yoooo)
Yooo (yoooo)
A yoooo ( a yoooo)---Lyrics submitted by sharon.
