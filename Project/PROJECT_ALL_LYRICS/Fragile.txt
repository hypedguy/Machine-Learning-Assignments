Crazy to think that a man can't hurt
Love takes its toll every time it don't work, yeah
One door closes and another opens
But it's hard to let go when your heart's broken
I give you my trust, can you give me your word?

Come take my heart of glass
And give me your love
I hope you'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile

After he left you and ten times ten
Could I put you back together again? Yeah
When a door closes and another opens
But I won't let go cause I'm not like him
Baby just say the words, let the love begin

Come take my heart of glass
And give me your love
I hope you'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby I'm fragile, fragile, fragile

Yeah, you will take yours and mine
I got your heart of glass
And you've got my love
I know we'll still be there
To pick the pieces up
Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile
Cause baby we're fragile, fragile, fragile---
