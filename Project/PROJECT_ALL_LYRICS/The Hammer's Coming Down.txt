Where will you be when the sky comes down?
What would you do if the strength was found?
Stay right beside me when the ground starts shaking
The only sound you'll lose is the breath we're taking

If there's only one thing I can promise you
You'll see the light again
This the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky moon
And without warning now
This is the rocket we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming

Once it's starting, there's no turning back
But I'll be with you when the sun turns black
'Cause finding faith will always be the hardest
While you standing in the heart of darkness

If there's only one thing I can promise you
You'll see the light again
This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the red sky moon
And without warning now
This is the pocket we've been waiting for
And there's no sense in running
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down
The hammer's coming down, down

Holding on, we'll make it till the dawn
And it'll be here, be for long
Holding on, if we can find the light
We can make our way back home
Holding on, we'll make it till the dawn
And it'll be here, be for long
Holding on, if we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on

Holding on, we'll make it till the dawn
And it'll be here, be for long
Holding on, if we can find the light
We can make our way back home
Holding on, we'll make it till the dawn
And it'll be here, be for long
Holding on, if we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on

This is the calm before the coming storm
This is the pocket we've been waiting for

Holding on, we'll make it till the dawn
And it'll be here, be for long
Holding on, if we can find the light
We'll find the light, come on---
