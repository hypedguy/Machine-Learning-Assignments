Are you comfortable right there, right there?
Let the groove get in there, there, right there
[repeat]

Come on shake - like you know you got something to prove
Baby mama, move like the groove's taking over you
Make no mistake - you're in the place to be by far
So let's get crazy like we ain't never gonna see tomorrow
Come on

Are you comfortable right there, right there?
Let the groove get in there, there, right there
[repeat]

Let the groove get in you

Shake - like you know you got nothing to lose
Make it move - girl, you know what we came to do
Make no mistake - you're in the place to be by far
So let's get crazy like we ain't never gonna see tomorrow
Come on now

Are you comfortable right there, right there?
Let the groove get in there, there, right there
[repeat]

Cause when the groove gets on, move it slow
And if you need some, here, take mine
Cause when my groove gets on, move it slow
So let's have the night, oh, the night

Are you comfortable right there, right there?
Let the groove get in there, there, right there
[repeat]

Cause when the groove gets on, move it slow
And if you need some, here, take mine
Cause when my groove gets on, move it slow
So let's have the night, oh, the night

Are you comfortable right there, right there?
Let the groove get in there, there, right there
[repeat]

Are you comfortable?
Are you comfortable?
Are you comfortable?
There, there right there
There, there right there
There, there right there

Let the groove get in you
Let the groove get in you

All night long, just let the groove get in
All night long, you can let the groove get in
[repeat]---
