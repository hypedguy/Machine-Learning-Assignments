(Lil Wayne talking)
Stop, Oh
Who it be nigga? Oh
Weezy Wee nigga, Oh
Lets Go, Oh
Uh-Oh, Uh-Oh
Get off the corner
Uh-Oh, Uh-Oh
Get off the corner
Uh-Oh
Listen
Uh-Oh

(Verse 1)
The block is hot, The cops is swarmin a neighborhood heavy
While niggas off in the neighborhood sellin', With penitentiary chances
The dope roped up in a couple of pants is
Fiends flock like ??? come get this candy
I got Heroin bundles and them Highland O's
Plus a cooked slab, Chopped up, Dimes is swoll
If I spot the laws comin', Hey it's time to roll
Candy Carter got a line of parole, Outta control
The first fell on a Tuesday this month Oh
Sweet thang, Plus it's a sweet thing
In ??? for three days
One time you say what u mean
I gets the green
Break up the block like Maurice Green
Ya feel me, In my predicament
I'm guilty until proven innocent
Hustle ridiculous, I'm trying' to get this dope continuos
Ball 'til I fall, One thing I aint tryin' to fall
Want everybody numb like Ambasol
They heard me.....

(Chorus 4x)
Uh-Oh
There go them fuckin' Po-Po's (Uh-Oh)
And if you know like I know (Uh-Oh)
You better get off the corner (Uh-Oh)

(Verse 2)
I'm a young dogg, wildin ecstatic
Violent on acid, them gangsta's doin' time in emparishment
Role models, Keep ya cut, They drank whole bottles
An cuss at niggas, You like fuck that nigga
I let my pump suck track niggas
You beef with me, I guarantee ya mams' will be missin
With a note behind demandin' three chickens
Or she gets it, Do not twist it
We cut ya ???, Have ya body in three different places
Aint nothin' gravy, But save it
Cause I'm a rider, Hit a nigga street
Weezy go to war like Sudam and Clinton disagree
While I'm shitty from the weed
Like where them bustas be
I promise ya never fuckin' sleep, I clear the set
Come outside late at night, To ya surprise I'm here with Teck's
Two shots knock off a niggas neck, it's so realistic
So I hope you get it, or else them shots poke ya fifty
Be on the block 'til them Soldiers hit it
That's when he heard.....

(Chorus 4x)
Blocka
Me come and tear ya block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner

(Verse 3)
Ok I cook ya cut, An ship an move it
I make a livin' in this crooked public distrubutin'
Just take a peek around, Cause when blood is shootin'shit is boomin'
The hottest D in town
Lookin' for me, Have me toasted like after six
See I crack the bricks right down to Z's
Got pounds of trees, My blocks blazin' qp's to ki's
Gangin in the cheese, Them bricks is comin'
No drop sound sit on nothin'
I don't believe I'm frontin'
If I give you a dime, I leave with somethin'
The big dog, Nigga I got the city under siege
An the law don't bother me, I give the pigs a couple of G's
Shiiit, I hustle stronger pushin' this work through the streets
I'm tryin' to deal with every nigga, Settle birds up cheap
I'm greedy
Yes I see this money bein' made from drugs, I need it
Twenty wrists tweeds completed
You can't beat it
Whatever you want, Holla at me when you need to get it
Does anybody else?, I pay them a visit
That's when they heard.....

(Chorus 4x)
Come here peeps
I'm hearin that you run the streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner

(After Chorus)
Uh-Oh
There go them fuckin' Po-Po's (Uh-Oh)
And if you know like I know (Uh-Oh)
You better get off the corner (Uh-Oh)
Blocka
Me come and tear ya block up
If you don't want no problems
You better get off the corner
Come here peeps
I'm hearin that you run the streets
You don't want beef
Then get off the corner
Come here peeps
I'm hearin' that you run the streets
You don't want beef
