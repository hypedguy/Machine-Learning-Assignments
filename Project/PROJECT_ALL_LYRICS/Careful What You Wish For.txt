So this is it?
This is what I wished for
This isnt how I envisioned it
Fame to the point of imprisonment
I just this shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that i got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldnt quit
I just wanted a little bit
Them it turned me to a monster 
I became a hypocrite
Concert after concert
I was raking in the dough
Rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sowing machine
But I was losing my freedom
There was no one for me
To not go and be seen
And just go and be me
And there was no in between
You either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 years later they go back and re-rate it
And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic
The Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didnt have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just aint pass yet
A couple more years that shit'll be illmatic 
And 8 years later I'm still at it
Divorced, remarried
A felon,a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk
I feel like the Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk

[Chorus]
So be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold
I said be careful what you wish for
Cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might ot know
What to do with it cause it might just come back on you tenfold

I got a letter from a fan that said
He's been praying for me
Everyday, and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But some thing told me to go ahead and open it but
Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you
You didn't pray for me when i was local
And as i lay these vocals
I think of all the shit i had to go through
Just to get to where I'm at
I've already told you atleast a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer, but i've already got God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride hasn't it?
Just watching it from an opposite stand point
Man boy's got to look... nuts
And that's the only word I can think of right now on how
To describe this shit
It's just like  a vibe you get
Go ahead  and bop to it just watch what you wish for cause i got the shit
