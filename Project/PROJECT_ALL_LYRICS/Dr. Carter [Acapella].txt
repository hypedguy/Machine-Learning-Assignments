[Intro: Lil Wayne & Nurse]
Where's my coffee?
Good Morning Doctor Carter (Hey Sweetie)
Looks like it's going to be a long day. (Ahh another one hmm, what we got?)
Your first patient, (Yeah)
Is suffering from a lack of concept, (Uh-Huh)
Originality, (Ugh)
His flow is weak, (Another one)
And he has no style. (Ugh)
Whatcha got for um?

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ok.Let me put my gloves on and my scrubs on.Dr.Carter to the rescue. Excuse me if I'm late,
But like a thief it takes time to be this great.
Ha! so just wait. Your style is a disgrace,
Your rhymes are 5th. place and I'm just grace.
One, Uno, Ace and I'm tryin to make your heart beat like bass,
But it's sweet like cake and I come to fix
Whatever you shall break. Where is your originality?
You are so fake so picture me like a gallery.
Capture What I say. All I need is one mic. All I need is one take.
Like hey, brighter then the sun ray got a pistols on the playground.
Watch the gun play like.No kidding. No kids in the way,
But the kids do watch. Gotta Watch what we say. Gotta work everyday.
Gotta not be Cliche.
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K.
Gotta, kick it, kick it like the sensate.
You gotta have faith you gotta gotta wait wait...
I think I, I think I lost him.

[Nurse on phone]
Dial 1.18 please.

[Nurse]
Good afternoon Dr. Carter. (Worse?)
I don't know about this one.
His confidence is down,
vocab. and meta fores needs work,
and he lacks respect for the game. (uggghhhhaaaa, let me see)
Do you think you can save him?

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Okay.
Respect is in the heart.
So that's where I'm a start.
And a lot of heart patients don't make it.
But hey kids
Plural I graduated
Cause you could get through anything if Magic made it.
And that was called recycling
Or rereciting
Something cause you just like it
So you say it just like it.
Some say it's biting
But I say it's enlightning,
Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest.
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest.
And Dr. Jeezy can fix your back up the nicest.
Authritist in my hand from writing.
But I'm a docter they don't understand my writing.
So I stop writing.
Now I'm like lighting.
And you ain't Vince Young so don't clash with the Titans.
Fast and exciting.
My Passion is Frighting.
Now let me put some more Vocab in your I.V.
Here take this Vicatin
Like it and love it
And confidence has no budget, so pay me no mind I don't walk like I talk it cause I'm running I don't do it cause I done it and I'm in the emergency punnet.
Got dammit I lost another one.

[Nurse]
Good evening Dr. Carter,
It's been a long day,
this one is much better than the others,
his respect is back up,
concepts sound good,
style is showin strong side of improvement,
all he needs now is his swagger.

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Let me take the gloves off then.
Swagger Tighter Then A Yeast Infection.
Fly Go Hard Like Yeast Erection.
Fashion Patrol Police Detection.
I Stay Tight Like Chinese Connection.
I Stay Tight Like Pussy At Night.
Baby Don't Get Me Wrong I Could Do That Pussy Right.
But I'm Too Wrong To Write.
Too Fresh To Fight.
Too Paid To Freestyle.
Too Paid To Freestyle.
I Had To Say It Twice
Swagger So Nice.
And Don't Ask Me Shit Unless It Concern A Price.
And I Don't Rap Fast I Rap Slow.
Cause I Mean Every Letter In The Words In The Sentence Of My Quotes.
Swagger Just Flow Sweeter Then Honey Oats.
That Swagger I Got It I Wear It Like A Coat.
Wait, As I Put The Light Down His Throat.
I Can Only See Flow.
His Blood Starting To Flow.
His Lungs Starting To Grow.
This One Starting To Show.
Strong Signs Of Life.
Wheres The Stitches Heres The Knife.
Smack His Face His Eyes Open.
I Reply With A Nice Welcome Back.
Hip Hop I Saved Your Life.

[Nurse]
He looks good,
his vitals are up,
he's looking good,
he's looking good,
I think we got one,
Dr. Carter I think we got one,
Yep, yep we got one,
You saved him he's good,
he's good,
he's good,
we got one he's good,
he's good,
You got him,
we saved him,
he's a goner.
he's good.---Lyrics submitted by Leandra.
